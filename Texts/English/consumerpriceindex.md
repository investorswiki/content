# Consumer Price Index (CPI)
## What Is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Simple Terms?
The consumer price index is basically an assortment of average current prices of common goods and services weighted by accessible data about consumption. The resulting figure changes over the long run, and the amount it changes over a specific period of time can offer understanding into the rate of [inflation](/inflation) (or deflation) over that period.
Similarly that a specialist chooses a sample of guineas pigs to probe in the hope that that sample is a fair representation of the total population they wish to study, the Bureau of Labor Statistics chooses a sample of goods and services thought to be representative of common products and services at large. The prices inside every product category are averaged, then those averages are weighted by the amount of an individual's total spending would probably be dedicated to every category.
By analyzing the degree to which this weighted average changes, we can perceive how quickly the cost of living has changed over the course of the past month, quarter, year, or decade. For example, "from 2019 to 2020, consumer prices for all things rose 1.4 percent" as indicated by the BLS.
**Note:** The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates various CPIs intended to follow different product types, populations, and locales. Unless in any case noted, for the purposes of this article, we are discussing the CPI named "All things in U.S. city average, every single urban consumer, not seasonally adjusted."
## How Does the CPI Relate to Inflation?
The CPI is perhaps of the most popular measurement used to estimate the rate of inflation. Since the CPI is updated and reported month to month, it tends to be used to estimate the rate of inflation over as short a period as a single month.
### Instructions to Calculate Inflation Using the CPI
To calculate an estimated rate of inflation over a particular period of time, essentially subtract the more established CPI from the later, then partition the result by the former and multiply by 100.
Suppose we wanted to calculate the rate of inflation from January 2015 to January 2020. To start with, we'd have to gather the CPI values for every one of those dates. Then, at that point, we can calculate the rate of inflation over that five-year period.
> January 2015 CPI-U: 233.707
>
> January 2020 CPI-U: 257.971

> Rate of Inflation (Jan. 2015-Jan. 2020) = (257.971 - 233.707)/233.707
>
> Rate of Inflation (Jan. 2015-Jan. 2020) = 24.264/233.707
>
> Rate of Inflation (Jan. 2015-Jan. 2020) = 0.1038
>
> Rate of Inflation (Jan. 2015-Jan. 2020) = 10.38%

Thus, the rate of inflation between January 2015 and January 2020 — as estimated by the CPI — was 10.38 percent.
## How Is the CPI Calculated?
The CPI referenced above is calculated (pretty much) like this: The BLS gathers and averages current prices for a number of comparable products inside a category (e.g., jars of black beans or gallons of gas). The average for every category is then assigned a weight (i.e., a percentage share of the index) in light of the average extent of consumer spending it is thought to account for. The categories are then averaged by their separate weights. The resulting number can then measure up to those of previous months, years, or decades.
The CPI was initially made such that it would equal 100 for the period from 1982 to 1984. Thus, 100 can be subtracted from the CPI for any subsequent year, and the result is the rate of inflation starting around 1984. As of October 2021, the CPI was 276.589, meaning goods and services had become more expensive by an average of about 176.589% beginning around 1984.
## What Does the CPI Actually Measure?
The CPI doesn't measure inflation or the cost of living directly. All things considered, it accumulates, averages, and gauges the current prices of a variety of products and services inside categories that are thought to be representative of regular consumer spending designs. In this sense, CPI is a greater amount of an assessment of the cost of living than a direct measure of it.
## What Product and Service Categories Are Included in the CPI?
The BLS samples north of 200 product and service categories while incorporating the CPI, but every one of these 200 categories generally can be categorized as one of eight major groups:
1. Food and drinks
1. Housing
1. Apparel
1. Transportation
1. Medical care
1. Diversion
1. Education and communication
1. Different goods and services

## How Are the Product and Service Categories Included in the CPI Determined?
The BLS bases the product categories (and their weights inside the index) on real spending data given by real individuals and families about their real-world shopping habits and routine expenditures. That being said, individuals surveyed for this data address just a small part of the U.S. population. Also, gathering data takes time, so CPI inclusions are usually founded on survey data that is one to three years of age.
As per the BLS, "CPI data in 2020 and 2021 depended on data collected from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 2017 and 2018. In every one of those years, about 24,000 consumers from around the country gave data each quarter on their spending habits in the meeting survey."
## CPI versus PPI: What's the Difference?
The CPI measures the average cost of goods and services purchased by consumers (a.k.a. end-users) in the U.S. All in all, it is a calculation of the estimated value of products and services at their last objective — the consumer. Thus, it includes imported products and services, and sales tax is included in its part prices
[The producer price index (PPI)](/ppi), then again, measures the cost of goods and services when they first leave their starting point — when they are sold wholesale by their producers (usually to different businesses, often many strides before they arrive at consumers). Sales tax isn't included in the PPI's part prices, and imports are overlooked because the PPI just considers homegrown produced products.
**Note:** PPI and CPI in all actuality do have some overlap, as certain products and services are sold directly from U.S. producers to U.S. consumers.
### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Below are replies to the absolute most common questions investors have about the CPI that were not currently tended to in this article.
### What Are the Two Main CPIs?
The CPI referenced over (the index for every urban consumer) is intended to address 93% of the total U.S. population, including individuals who are employed, self-employed, unemployed, and retired.
The BLS likewise gathers a subsequent CPI intended to address just urban wage earners and clerical workers, who make up roughly 29% of the total U.S. population. This group is a subset of the principal population that is sampled to make the CPI for all urban consumers referenced previously.
### What's the significance here When the CPI Changes?
At the point when the CPI goes up over the long haul, it means that the cost of living is going up. As such, inflation is occurring. If, then again, the CPI goes down after some time, this shows that the cost of living is going down, or that **deflation** is occurring.
### Could CPI at any point Be Negative?
The CPI can certainly go down after some time, so a change in CPI can occur in a negative direction, but since it is a measure of weighted average endlessly prices are generally positive, the CPI itself can't be negative.
### When Is the Updated CPI Released?
Every month, usually close by the fifteenth at 8:30 am Eastern time, the BLS releases CPI values for the previous month.

### Are Price Indexes Similar to Stock Indexes?
Price indexes are like [stock indexes](/marketindex) in that both track the average prices of an assortment of things over the long run, and both weigh part things in light of some factor or another. Many stock indexes weigh part companies by [market cap](/capitalization) (a measure of company size), while price indexes weigh part product and service categories by their presumed share of an average resident's spending. Both are used as economic indicators and benchmarks.

## Features
- The widely quoted CPI depends on an index covering 93% of the U.S. population, while a connected index covering wage earners and clerical workers is used for cost-of-living adjustments to federal benefits
- The CPI It is the most widely used measure of inflation, closely followed by policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and consumers.
- Housing rents are used to estimate the change in shelter costs including proprietor occupied housing that account for almost a third of the CPI.
- The CPI depends on about 94,000 price quotes collected month to month from approximately 23,000 retail and service foundations as well as 43,000 rental housing units
- The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer prices over the long run in light of a representative basket of goods and services.
## FAQ
### How Is the CPI Calculated?
The Bureau of Labor Statistics samples 94,000 prices month to month to calculate the CPI, gauging the index for every product or service in relation to its share of recent consumer spending to calculate the overall change in prices. The calculation likewise factors in the substitution effect as consumers shift spending away from the products rising in price on a relative basis. The CPI likewise adjusts for changes in product quality and features. The numbers are furnished with and without seasonal adjustments.
### How Is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Used?
The CPI Index is an inflation indicator closely watched by policymakers and financial markets. A connected CPI measure is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for federal benefit payments.
### What Are Some Criticisms of the CPI?
Throughout the long term, the CPI has frequently drawn analysis that it has either understated or exaggerated inflation. Because the CPI depends on consumer spending, it doesn't follow third-party reimbursements for healthcare, and fundamentally underweights healthcare relative to its extent in the GDP as a result. Then again, analysis concerning the quality adjustments used in the CPI has been widely discounted by market analysts.
