# Clean Sheeting
## What Is Clean Sheeting?

Clean sheeting is the fraudulent act of purchasing a life insurance policy without uncovering a pre-existing terminal illness or disease. This type of fraud is many times finished with the information on the purchaser and the agent.

## Seeing Clean Sheeting

In instances of clean sheeting, the policy is many times sold soon after it is purchased in a [viatical settlement](/viaticalsettlement), however the money received is significantly not as much as what a genuine settlement would yield. This is on the grounds that there is a higher chance that the fraudulent policy will be [rescinded](/rescission). This type of fraud gives gigantic gains to the person who buys out the purchaser since they are able to buy the policy at a large discount, somewhere near 10% of the policy's face value.

## To Tell the Truth

Life insurance companies take great measures to ensure they are charging enough for the [risks](/risk) of every client. In this way, while applying for a life policy, a series of inquiries must be completed, generally online or via mail, that ask about smoking, circulatory strain, dangerous side interests, and family history, to give some examples areas of inquiry.

A follow-up call asks similar inquiries then, at that point, for the most part adds many others, frequently with the language "have you" or "have you at any point been." It's not difficult to neglect (or lie) about an old injury or some other medical condition, however the insurer will recall. Any omissions or irregularities with medical or different records might bring about a denied claim or the return of the premiums paid.

An unscrupulous agent might propose that there's no damage in lying in this cycle. The agent will collect their commissions and continue on. In the mean time, those mistakes will remain and in the event that you make a claim in the contestable period, the records will be gone over with the utmost attention to detail.

In insurance, a [incontestability clause](/incontestability-clause) is a clause in most life insurance policies that prevents the provider from voiding coverage due to an error by the insured after a specific amount of time has elapsed. A regular incontestability clause indicates that a contract will not be voidable following a few years due to a misquote.

A few states allow insurance companies to incorporate a provision, expressing that a couple of year contestability period must be completed inside the lifetime of the insured. In this scenario, a life insurance company can decline to pay benefits assuming a policyholder was so unwell when they applied for coverage that they kicked the bucket before the contestability period was finished. A few states likewise allow the insurance company to void a policy on the off chance that conscious fraud is proven.

## Illustration of Clean Sheeting

Lonnie Harwell and Penni Alexander-Harwell enrolled terminally ill patients, essentially those that experienced HIV/AIDS, to buy insurance policies without revealing imperative facts connected with their wellbeing. The policies had low values, going from between $25,000 to $150,000, and were issued to people between 15-50 years old. In particular, they didn't need physical examination or bloodwork as prior conditions for issue.

The Harwells paid a percentage of the claimed amount as well as the premiums. The patients benefited from getting the lump sum payments. After the patient's death, the Harwells claimed the insurance amount. They benefited from "stacking" several such policies together.

The Harwells had laid out a network for references of such patients with a $1,000 reference benefit. The California Department of Insurance (CDI) claimed that insurance companies issued more than $11.6 million worth of policies to such people.
