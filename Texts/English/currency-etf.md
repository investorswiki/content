A large number of similar rules of modern finance, similar to diversification and risk management, apply to trading the currency market.

A few investors are of the conviction that it isn't beneficial to invest a dollar in a currency ETF to hedge every dollar of overseas investment. Notwithstanding, since currency ETFs are edge qualified, this hurdle can be overwhelmed by utilizing edge accounts (brokerage accounts in which the [brokerage](/brokerage-organization) loans the client part of the funds for investment) for both the overseas investment and currency ETF.

## Illustration of Currency ETFs

Think about a U.S. investor with $10,000 in Canadian stocks through the iShares MSCI Canada Index Fund (EWC). With shares priced at $33.16 toward the finish of June 2008, that investor would have acquired 301.5 shares (barring brokerage charges and [commissions](/commission)). To hedge forex risk, they could sell short shares of the CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (FXC), which mirrors the price of the Canadian dollar in U.S. dollars. At the point when an investor is long the ETF, FXC shares rise when the Canadian dollar reinforces against the U.S. dollar. Shorting makes the contrary outcome.

Assuming this investor figures the Canadian dollar will appreciate, they would either abstain from hedging the exchange risk or "bend over" on the Canadian dollar exposure by buying (or "going long") FXC shares. However, since we expect the investor needs to hedge exchange risk, the suitable course of action would have been to "short sell" the FXC units.

In this model, with the Canadian dollar trading close to [parity](/parityprice) with the U.S. dollar at that point, expect that the FXC units were sold short at $100. Hence, to hedge the $10,000 position in the EWC units, the investor would short sell 100 FXC shares, buying them back at a cheaper price later in the event that the FXC shares fell.

Toward the finish of 2008, the EWC shares tumbled to $17.43, a 47.4% drop from the purchase price. Part of this decline in the share price could be credited to the drop in the loonie against the greenback. The investor who had a hedge in place would have offset a portion of this loss through a gain in the short FXC position. FXC shares dropped to about $82 toward the finish of 2008, so the gain on the short position would have added up to $1,800. The unhedged investor would have had a loss of $4,743 on the initial $10,000 investment in the EWC shares. The hedged investor would have had an overall loss of $2,943 on the portfolio.
