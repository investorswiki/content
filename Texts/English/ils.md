## What Is the ILS?

ILS is the international three-letter condensing for the Israeli new shekel, the currency of Israel beginning around 1986. The new shekel supplanted the hyper-swelled original shekel at a ratio of 1000 to 1. At that point, it was recognized by the shortening NIS to recognize it from the old shekel.

As of August 26, 2020, the new shekel is valued at $0.31.

## Figuring out the ILS

The ILS is the nation of Israel's fourth currency. The original currency after the country was established in 1948 was the Palestine Pound, which turned into the Israel Pound in 1952. Both were pegged to the [British pound](/gbp) (GBP) initially, yet the Israeli pound ended its relationship to British sterling in 1954.

Numerous Israelis pushed for a currency with a Hebrew name, however it took until 1980 for the country to drop its pound note and present the main shekel (presently known as the old shekel). "Shekel" dates to scriptural times and may whenever have been a measure of grain.

From its origin, the old shekel was a weak currency because of the country's faltering state-based economy of the period. An all out financial crisis during the 1980s prompted enormous inflation. In the long run, the government balanced out the economy and presented unrestricted economy changes, alongside the new shekel in 1986. From that point forward, the ILS has been one of the more stable currencies in the world. It turned out to be openly [convertible](/convertible-currency) in 2003 and started trading through derivatives in 2006 on the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME).

## Special Considerations
### Images on ILS Coins

The new shekel is comprised of 100 agorot. Eight coins are stamped; the denominations are one, five, and 10 agorot; and a 1/2, one, two, five, and 10 sheqalim. The coins have no pictures of individuals. All things considered, they feature different Israeli national images like the menorah, the lily, and the lyre.

### Hebrew Poets Honored on Bills

The original one-shekel banknote carried a picture of the archaic Jewish scholar Moses Maimonides; the ten-shekel note depicted former prime minister Golda Meir. The current bills, which started circulating in 2014, are printed in four denominations, all of which depict Israeli artists on the front-side: Rachel Bluwstein on the 20-shekel note; Shaul Tchernichovsky on the 50-shekel note; Leah Goldberg on the 100-shekel note; and Nathan Alterman on the 200-shekel note. Every one of the bills likewise remembers miniature printed verse by the featured creator for the two sides.

The current series was originally planned to incorporate pictures of the deceased Israeli leaders Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin. Yet, after Begin's family dismissed the plan, the series was changed to respect just writers.
