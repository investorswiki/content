# Simon Kuznets
## Who Was Simon Kuznets?

Simon Kuznets, a Russian-American [development economist](/development-economics) and analyst, was granted the 1971 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his research on economic growth. He set the standard for national income accounting, empowering accurate estimates of [gross national product](/gnp) to be calculated interestingly.

## Figuring out Simon Kuznets

Simon Kuznets set the standard for [national income accounting](/national_income_accounting) — financed by the nonprofit [National Bureau of Economic Research](/nber). His measures of savings, consumption and investment helped advance [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics) and advanced the study of econometrics. He likewise helped establish the groundwork for the study of trade cycles, known as "Kuznets cycles," and developed thoughts regarding the relationship between economic growth and income inequality.

Kuznets was brought into the world in Ukraine in 1901, and moved to the U.S. in 1922. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University and was a teacher of economics and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania (1930-54), a teacher of political economy at Johns Hopkins (1954-60), and a teacher of economics at Harvard (1960-71). He kicked the bucket in 1985 in Cambridge, MA.

## Kuznets Curve

Kuznets' work on economic growth and income distribution drove him to estimate that industrializing nations experience a rise and subsequent decline in economic inequality, described as an inverted "U" — the "Kuznets curve."

He figured economic inequality would increase as rural labor migrated to the urban communities, keeping wages down as workers went after positions. Yet, as per Kuznets, social mobility increases again once a certain level of income was reached in "modern" industrialized economies, as the welfare state grabs hold.

Be that as it may, since Kuznets proposed this theory during the 1970s, income inequality has increased in advanced developed countries — in spite of the fact that inequality has declined in quickly developing East Asian countries.

## Environmental Kuznets Curve

A modification of Kuznets curve has become well known to chart the rise and subsequent decline in pollution levels of creating economies. First developed by Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger in a 1995 NBER paper and later promoted by the World Bank, the environmental Kuznets curve follows a similar fundamental pattern as the original Kuznets curve.

Hence, environmental indicators break down as an economy industrializes until a defining moment is reached. The indicators then start improving again with the aid of new technology and more money that is piped back to society to work on the environment.

There is mixed empirical evidence to demonstrate legitimacy of the environmental Kuznets curve. For instance, carbon emissions have consistently risen for both developed and creating economies. The development of modern carbon trading infrastructure likewise means that developed economies are not really diminishing pollution but rather exporting it to creating economies, which are additionally engaged with delivering goods for them.

All things considered, certain types of toxins declined as an economy industrialized. For instance, sulfur dioxide levels diminished in the United States with increased regulation even as the number of cars on its streets held consistent or increased.

## Evidence and Criticism of Kuznets Curve

Empirical evidence of Kuznets curve has been mixed. The industrialization of English society followed the curve's hypothesis. The [Gini coefficient](/gini-file), a measure of inequality in society, in England rose to 0.627 in 1871 from 0.400 in 1823. By 1901, be that as it may, it had fallen to 0.443. The quickly industrializing societies of France, Germany, and Sweden likewise followed a comparable direction of inequality around a similar time.

Be that as it may, Netherlands and Norway had an alternate experience and inequality declined, generally, reliably as their societies progressed from agrarian economies to industrial ones. The East Asian economies - Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan - likewise saw a consistent decline in their inequality numbers during their periods of industrialization.

Various speculations have been put forward to make sense of these anomalies. Some attribute it to social peculiarities. That clarification, nonetheless, doesn't account for the experiences of Netherlands and Norway rather than the remainder of Europe.

Others have zeroed in on development of political systems that empowered quick redistribution of wealth. For instance, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson placed that the inequality due to capitalist industrialization contained "seeds of its own obliteration" and gave approach to political and labor reform in Britain and France, empowering redistribution of wealth.

In East Asian economies land reforms that happened during the 1940s and 1950s assisted make ready for equitable redistribution with evening however political reform was delayed. As such, it was politics, and not economics as Kuznets suggested, that decided inequality levels.

At the point when he defined the concept, Kuznets himself suggested that there was considerably more work to be finished and data to be collected to demonstrate the relationship between economic development and inequality decisively.

## Features
- Kuznets is likewise known for the Kuznets curve, which conjectures that industrializing nations experience a rise and subsequent decline in income inequality.
- The rise in inequality happens after rural labor relocates to urban areas and turns out to be socially mobile. After a certain income level is reached, inequality declines as a welfare state grabs hold.
- Simon Kuznets, a Russian-American economist, set the standard for national income accounting that aided advance thoughts of Keynesian economics and the study of econometrics.
- A modification of the curve, known as environmental Kuznets curve, has become famous to chart the rise and decline of pollution in an industrializing country's economy.
