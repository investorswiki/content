## What Is a Change?

As a general rule, a change alludes to a price difference that happens between two points in time. This can allude to several specific price changes in finance, every one of which is calculated in a fairly specific way:

1. For an options or [futures contract](/futurescontract), it is the difference between the current price and the previous day's [settlement price](/settlementprice). For an index or average, change is the difference between the current value and the previous day's market close.
1. For a stock or bond quote, change is the difference between the current price and the last trade of the previous day.
1. For interest rates, change is benchmarked against a major market rate (e.g., [LIBOR](/libor)) and may just be refreshed as rarely as once a quarter.

## Figuring out Change

Change is a regularly involved term in the world of finance, however it has many names. A different way to say change is volatility. The change in earnings is depicted as earnings growth. The change in revenue is alluded to as revenue growth. The change in earnings divided by an investment, for example, assets or equity is alluded to as [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) or [return on assets](/returnonassets).

Fundamentally, change is the foundation for measuring and depicting data over a certain period of time. A positive change generally infers further developed performance, while a negative change suggests declining performance. The interpretation of the change is passed on to the analyst.

## The Value of Change

Option prices depend fundamentally on the scale of the change in the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). All in all, an option contract's value depends on evolving prices. For example, one type of option, alluded to as a [call](/calloption), is effectively a wagered that the price of the underlying asset will go up. Different options, alluded to as [puts](/putoption), put everything on the line of the underlying asset will go down.

Thus, option prices increase with [implied volatility (IV)](/iv).

## Computing Change

For instance, in the event that a company is trading at $10 toward the finish of the principal quarter and $20 toward the finish of the subsequent quarter, the change in price throughout the time span is $20 minus $10, or $10.

It is important while depicting this change to give it setting. In this case, the change is positive, yet by how much? To compare change, analysts divide the change in price by the price in the previous time span. In this model, the calculation is $10 divided by $10. The price went up from $10 to $20, so it multiplied. Similarly, $10 divided by $10 is 100%. One more method for reporting this change is to say the company's stock price developed 100% in the primary quarter.
