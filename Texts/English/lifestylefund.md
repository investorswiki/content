## What Is a Lifestyle Fund?

The term lifestyle fund alludes to an investment fund that manages a [diversified](/diversification) portfolio across assets with fluctuating risk levels. These funds determine the best [assets](/asset) for investors in light of their [risk tolerance](/risktolerance), age, and investment goals. They are generally appropriate for long-term investing — especially for the people who need a savings vehicle that they can cash out by a certain time like retirement.

## How Lifestyle Funds Work

There is definitely not a one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Investors have various necessities and goals, so they ought to pick investment vehicles tailored to their own requirements. Lifestyle funds are ordinarily intended to target an investor's [investment style](/investing_style) and stage of life. They can be marketed across a scope of styles tailored to an investor's risk tolerance going from conservative, moderate, and aggressive, and can be additionally expanded to incorporate income, growth, or value strategies.

Risk tolerances are commonly determined by the investor's age — [aggressive](/aggressiveinvestmentstrategy) funds are suggested for more youthful investors while [conservative](/conservativeinvesting) funds are focused on more seasoned investors who are nearer to retirement.

> More youthful investors can endure risk more and can, consequently, pick a more aggressive investment strategy compared to individuals who are nearer to retirement and can't bear to face too many challenges with their capital.

Lifestyle funds utilize a mix of assets and [asset allocation](/assetallocation) strategies in their approach, yet their goals are principally centered around furnishing investors with a vehicle for long-term investing. Lifestyle funds generally follow the traditional concept of [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT), utilizing an optimal mix of [equity](/equity) and [debt](/debt) in light of the fund's risk tolerance. They give substantially less risk than traditional funds by offering a more extensive scope of diversification.

Lifestyle funds are an emphasis of standard [balanced funds](/balancedfund). That is the reason fund managers manage their [portfolios](/portfolio) comparatively to these funds. There is a slight difference, however, since lifestyle funds generally try to furnish investors with a vehicle for investing toward a predetermined goal and [withdrawal](/withdrawal) date.

While retirement is a common goal, investors can involve these funds for a number of life occasions in light of a specific target date This is the reason some lifestyle funds are frequently compared to — and at times called — [target-date funds](/target-date_fund). That is on the grounds that both have the purpose of filling in as a vehicle for investing funds toward a specific goal.

Lifestyle funds are somewhat not the same as target-date funds on the grounds that their asset allocation doesn't shift in a manner that follows a glide path over the life of the investment. All things being equal, they center around giving either conservative, moderate, or aggressive risk allocations for investors beginning to invest at various stages of their lives.

## Special Considerations

In fund options that are more aggressive, investments might be diversified comprehensively across all market portions and global locales to accomplish maximum [returns](/get back) from all market opportunities.

In conservative funds, however, the assets are vigorously weighted toward lower-risk investments with greater allocations to fixed-income overall.
