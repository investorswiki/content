## How a Design Patent Works

A thing or item that is protected by a design patent conveys broad protection from [copyright infringement](/copyright-infringement). A design that was not expected to be a copy and which was contrived freely from an existing, design patent-protected thing might in any case encroach upon that design patent.

In Japan, secrecy can be extended to three years after registration is granted. The primary U.S. design patent was granted in 1842 for printing typefaces and border (text styles).
