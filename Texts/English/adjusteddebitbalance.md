# Adjusted Debit Balance
## What Is an Adjusted Debit Balance?

An adjusted debit balance is the amount in a [margin account](/marginaccount) that is owed to the brokerage firm, minus profits on short sales and balances in a [special miscellaneous account](/specialmemorandumaccount) (SMA). Debit balances can be stood out from credit balances, which are funds owed to a customer's margin account by their broker.

## How Adjusted Debit Balances Work

A [debit balance](/debitbalance), as a rule, is what a customer owes their broker in a margin account — an account that allows investors to borrow funds to purchase securities, gave they have cash or securities in it to pledge as collateral and pay the lender a [periodic interest rate](/periodic_interest_rate).

The utilization of trading margin ([leverage](/leverage)) in an investment account to buy securities enhances the gains or losses associated with those trades. To assist with diminishing huge losses experienced by brokerage firms and investors due to unregulated margin trading, [Regulation T](/regulationt) (REG T) rules and the half rule was laid out, specifying that an investor can borrow up to half of the purchase price of a security on margin.

The adjusted debit balance illuminates investors the amount they owe in the event of a [margin call](/margincall) — a demand for extra cash or securities to bring a margin account up to the base [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin). This balance is made accessible to clients routinely, guaranteeing that they can continuously keep tabs on any borrowed funds that they are required to pay back to the brokerage firm.

The [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) has set the base maintenance margin at 25% of the total value of the securities in a margin account. Notwithstanding, [broker firms](/brokerage-organization) frequently expect that their customers hold greater equity.
