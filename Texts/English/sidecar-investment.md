# Sidecar Investment
## What Is a Sidecar Investment?

A sidecar investment is a [strategy](/investmentstrategy) in which one investor permits a second investor to control how to invest their capital. A sidecar investment as a rule happens when one of the parties misses the mark on ability or confidence to invest for themselves. This type of strategy actually places trust in another person's ability to gain profits.

Outsourcing investment choices to professional financial advisors, portfolio managers, or [sub-advised funds](/subadvisedfund) are common instances of utilizing sidecar investment.

## Figuring out Sidecar Investments

"Sidecar" alludes to a bike sidecar; the person riding in the sidecar must place their trust in the driver's skills. This contrasts from [coattail investing](/coattailinvesting), where one investor impersonates the moves of another. A variation of sidecar investment is the sidecar fund, which is an investment vehicle where several groups with various interests are involved. For instance, passive investors, as well as institutional investors or [limited partnerships (LPs)](/limitedpartnership) keen on more arrangement creating open doors, can be a part of a similar vehicle investing in companies and startups.

Sidecar investments and coattail investments are typically not central principles in portfolio management. Portfolio management is a complex art and science that incorporates several types of strategies, potentially including sidecar investment, under a large umbrella or [investment policy](/ips). Portfolio managers must match their investments to the objectives of the client (individual or institutional). They for the most part have a fiduciary duty to do as such.

## Sidecar Investment and Portfolio Management

Portfolio managers will determine a specific asset allocation, adjusting risk against performance, by spreading out investments among stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, private equity, and venture capital, and that's just the beginning. For every asset class, investment managers determine particular qualities, shortcomings, opportunities, and dangers. For instance, in the event that a client can't face huge risk, challenges manager could choose to place the majority of assets in domestic rather than international markets and spotlight on safety instead of growth. A heap of compromises exists and require consistent research and carefulness.

## Illustration of Sidecar Investing

Assume there are two individuals â€” Jessica, who is knowledgeable about trading corporate bonds, and Barney, who has experience with real estate. Jessica and Barney choose to cooperate by means of a sidecar investing strategy. In this case, Jessica would give Barney money to invest in real estate for her sake, and Barney would give Jessica funds to invest in company bonds. This setup permits both Jessica and Barney to broaden their [portfolios](/portfolio) and benefit from one another's skill.

Here is an extra illustration of coattail investing: A money manager or institution purchases companies with a purchase and-hold mentality (i.e., they make wagers as long as possible), and a [retail investor](/retailinvestor), despite the fact that they probably won't approach the full breakdown of the manager's portfolio, can access the manager's main ten holdings in a public [investment policy statement (IPS)](/ips) and follow suit. Nonetheless, in the event that the manager purchases securities with a short time horizon and habitually turns over their holdings, keeping track can be troublesome.
