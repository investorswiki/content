# Homestead Exemption
## What is homestead exemption?
Homestead exemption laws prevent the sale of a home to pay off taxes or creditors. Virtually every state in the U.S. has homestead exemption laws, and keeping in mind that the terms shift significantly from one state to another, they all expect to bring down property taxes and secure a family's right to continuous utilization of their home.
## More profound definition
Homestead exemptions were first offered as soon as 1839 in the Republic of Texas, before the region joined the U.S. They work on the rule that preservation of the homestead is a higher priority than settling outstanding debts, and give a degree of invulnerability from certain property taxes.
A homestead is defined as a house and its bordering land and structures, legally registered as the principal dwelling place of a family. A few states offer programmed homestead rights; in different states, it's important to register a claim through a cycle called homesteading, by which the head of the household makes a written declaration that a property is the family's principal dwelling.
The debt exemption part by and large prevents creditors from driving a sale of a home to pay outstanding debt. There is a major exception in essentially all homestead laws: in the event that the house is collateral on a mortgage loan, the mortgage holder actually has the option to dispossess. In certain states there are different exceptions, like in Texas, where the homestead exemption doesn't make a difference in that frame of mind of debts owed to the federal government.
A few states offer exemption on some property tax owed on a home. This assists homeowners with saving money on taxes, normally by eliminating a fixed monetary amount from the value of the property for taxation purposes. The value of the accessible tax exemption fluctuates by state. In California, the exemption decreases the value of the property by $7,000 for tax purposes; in Louisiana, a homeowner is exempt from paying property taxes on the first $75,000 of the home's fair market value.
## Homestead exemption model
The Benedict family claims a monster farm in rural Texas valued at $300,000. The maximum accessible exemption (from neighborhood property taxes) is $25,000. Likewise, owners who are 65 or more seasoned get an extra $3,000 exemption. In the wake of applying the two exemptions (the female authority is more than 65), the Benedicts just owe neighborhood property taxes on $272,000 of the value of their farm.
