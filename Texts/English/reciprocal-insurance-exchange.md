# Reciprocal Insurance Exchange
## What Is a Reciprocal Insurance Exchange?

Reciprocal [insurance](/insurance) exchanges are a form of insurance organization wherein individuals and businesses exchange insurance contracts and spread the risks associated with those contracts among themselves. Policyholders of a reciprocal insurance exchange are alluded to as endorsers.

## How a Reciprocal Insurance Exchange Works

A reciprocal insurance exchange is formed by bringing together two separate elements — a reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and a [attorney-in-fact](/attorneyinfact) (AIF). The reciprocal inter-insurance exchange is utilized to permit endorsers of exchange policies through the attorney-in-fact, which permits them to spread around risk.

The attorney-in-fact is authorized to perform business transactions for the benefit of another entity, which, in this case, is the reciprocal insurance company. The AIF runs the everyday operations of the reciprocal and is given a [power of attorney](/powerofattorney) status by the reciprocal. The AIF might be owned by the reciprocal, alluded to as a proprietary reciprocal, or might be contracted from an outsider, alluded to as a non-proprietary reciprocal.

## Special Considerations

A [board of governors](/board-of-governors) deals with a reciprocal insurance company. The board is responsible for choosing and monitoring the attorney-in-fact, approving rates, and providing oversight of the operations of the reciprocal. Surpluses from premiums are held in separate surplus accounts committed to a specific purpose, however the accounts can be commingled and used to pay claims against the policies.

Reciprocal insurance companies can issue both [assessable](/assessable-policy) and non-assessable policies, with the last option being the most common policy issued. A non-assessable policy holds the policyholder back from being charged an extra amount of money in the event that the cost of operating the reciprocal is surprisingly high. This means that the financial liabilities of the policyholder are limited to the cost of the policy.

A reciprocal insurance exchange is not the same as a mutual insurance company, in which individuals and businesses with comparative insurance needs, for example, specialists, meet up to pool risks and obtain better rates.

## Illustration of Reciprocal Insurance Exchange

Reciprocal insurance exchanges started out in 1881 when six dry-great dealers in New York agreed to indemnify each other on account of their shared discontent with insurance companies.

This gathering's individuals all had buildings of prevalent construction and maintained them well, yet they were completely energized premiums that didn't compare to the expected losses for comparative commercial buildings.

At that point, insurance companies applied overgeneralized terms in their classification of risk; current rate-setting procedures hadn't exactly been developed yet. Able to retain certain losses, the dealers had the incentive and capacity to "self-insure" to bring down their costs.
