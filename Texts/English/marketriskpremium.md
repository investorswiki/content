# Market Risk Premium
## What Is the Market Risk Premium?

The market risk premium (MRP) is the difference between the expected return on a market portfolio and the risk-free rate.

The market risk premium is equivalent to the slant of the [security market line](/sml) (SML), a graphical representation of the [capital asset pricing model](/capm) (CAPM). CAPM measures the required rate of return on equity investments, and it is an important element of [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT) and [discounted cash flows](/dcf) (DCF) valuation.

## Understanding the Market Risk Premium

Market risk premium portrays the relationship between returns from an asset portfolio and [treasury bond](/treasurybond) yields. The risk premium mirrors the required returns, historical returns, and expected returns. The historical market risk premium will be no different for everything investors since the value depends on what really occurred. The required and expected market premiums, be that as it may, will vary from one investor to another in light of [risk tolerance](/risktolerance) and [investing styles](/investmentstyle).

Investors require compensation for risk and opportunity cost. The [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) is a hypothetical interest rate that would be paid by an investment with zero risks and long-term yields on U.S. Treasuries have customarily been utilized as a proxy for the risk-free rate due to the low default risk. Treasuries have historically had relatively low yields because of this assumed dependability. Equity market returns depend on expected returns on a broad benchmark index like the Standard and Poor's 500 index of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA).

Real equity returns vary with the operational performance of the underlying business, and the market pricing for these securities mirrors this reality. Historical return rates have vacillated as the economy develops and perseveres through cycles, however conventional information has generally estimated a long-term capability of roughly 8% annually. Investors demand a premium on their equity investment return relative to lower risk alternatives on the grounds that their capital is more endangered, which prompts the equity risk premium.

## Calculation and Application

The market risk premium can be calculated by deducting the risk-free rate from the expected equity market return, giving a quantitative measure of the extra return demanded by market participants for the increased risk. When calculated, the equity risk premium can be utilized in important calculations like CAPM.

Somewhere in the range of 1926 and 2014, the S&P 500 displayed a 10.5% accumulated annual rate of return, while the 30-day Treasury bill accumulated at 5.1%. This shows a market risk premium of 5.4%, in view of these boundaries.

The required rate of return for an individual asset can be calculated by increasing the asset's beta coefficient by the market coefficient, then adding back the risk-free rate. This is much of the time utilized as the discount rate in discounted cash flow, a well known valuation model.
