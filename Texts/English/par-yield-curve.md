# Par Yield Curve
## What Is a Par Yield Curve?

A par yield curve is a graphical representation of the yields of speculative Treasury securities with prices at par. On the par yield curve, the coupon rate will rise to the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) of the security, which is the reason the Treasury bond will trade at [par](/parvalue).

The par yield curve can measure up to the [spot yield curve](/spot_rate_yield_curve) and the forward yield curve for Treasuries.

## Understanding Par Yield Curves

The yield curve is a graph that shows the relationship between interest rates and bond yields of different maturities, going from three-month [Treasury bills](/treasurybill) to 30-year [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond). The graph is plotted with the y-pivot portraying interest rates and the x-hub showing the rising time durations.

Since short-term bonds regularly have lower yields than longer-term bonds, the curve slants upwards to the right. At the point when the yield curve is talked about, this typically alludes to the spot yield curve, explicitly, the spot yield curve for [risk-free bonds](/riskfreeasset). Nonetheless, there are a few occasions where one more type of yield curve is alluded to — the par yield curve.

The par yield curve graphs the YTM of coupon-paying bonds of various maturity dates. The yield to maturity is the return that a bond investor hopes to make assuming the bond will be held until maturity. A bond that is issued at [par](/parvalue) has a YTM that is equivalent to the [coupon rate](/coupon-rate). As interest rates vacillate after some time, the YTM either increases or diminishes to mirror the current interest rate environment.

For instance, in the event that interest rates decline after a bond has been issued, the value of the bond will increase given that the coupon rate fastened to the bond is currently higher than the interest rate. In this case, the coupon rate will be higher than the YTM. In effect, the YTM is the [discount rate](/discountrate) at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (that is, coupons and principal) is equivalent to the current price of the bond.

A par yield is the coupon rate at which bond prices are zero. A par yield curve addresses bonds that are trading at par. As such, the par yield curve is a plot of the yield to maturity against [term to maturity](/termtomaturity) for a group of bonds priced at par. It is utilized to determine the coupon rate that another bond with a given maturity will pay to sell at par today. The par yield curve gives a yield that is utilized to discount various cash flows for a coupon-paying bond. It involves the data in the spot yield curve, otherwise called the zero percent coupon curve, to discount every coupon by the proper spot rate.

Since duration is longer on the spot yield curve, the curve will continuously lie over the par yield curve when the par yield curve is up inclining, and lie below the par yield curve when the par yield curve is descending slanting.

## Determining the Par Yield Curve

Determining a par yield curve is one step toward making a hypothetical spot rate yield curve, which is then used to all the more accurately price a coupon-paying bond. A method known as [bootstrapping](/bootstrapping) is utilized to determine the arbitrage-free [forward interest rates](/forwardrate). Since Treasury bills offered by the government don't have data for each period, the bootstrapping method is utilized chiefly to fill in the missing figures to determine the yield curve. For instance, consider these bonds with face values of $100 and maturities of six months, one year, 18 months, and two years.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Maturity (years)</td><td> 0.5</td><td> 1</td><td> 1.5</td><td> 2</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Par yield</td><td> 2%</td><td> 2.3%</td><td> 2.6%</td><td> 3%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Since coupon payments are made semi-every year, the half year bond has just a single payment. Its yield is, subsequently, equivalent to the par rate, which is 2%. The one-year bond will have two payments made following six months. The primary payment will be $100 x (0.023/2) = $1.15. This interest payment ought to be discounted by 2%, which is the spot rate for quite some time. The subsequent payment will be the sum of the coupon payment and principal repayment = $1.15 + $100 = $101.15. We want to find the rate at which this payment ought to be discounted to get a par value of $100. The calculation is:

- $100 = $1.15/(1 + (0.02/2)) + $101.15/(1 + (x/2)) ^2^
- $100 = 1.1386 + $101.15/(1 + (x/2))^2^
- $98.86 = $101.15/(1 + (x/2)) ^2^
- (1 + (x/2)) ^2^ = $101.15/$98.86
- 1 + (x/2) = \u221a1.0232
- x/2 = 1.0115 - 1
- x = 2.302%

This is the zero-coupon rate for a one-year bond or the one-year spot rate. We can ascertain the spot rate for different bonds developing in 18 months and two years utilizing this cycle.

## Features
- The par yield curve interjects the yield curve for Treasury securities in view of all maturities being prices at par value.
- The par yield will regularly fall below both the spot and forward yield curves under normal conditions.
- At par value, the interest rate would should be indistinguishable from the coupon rate paid on the bond.
