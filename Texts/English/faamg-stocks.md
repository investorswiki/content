## What Are FAAMG Stocks?

FAAMG is a contraction authored by Goldman Sachs for five top-performing tech stocks in the market, to be specific, Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google. FAAMG may likewise go by the abbreviation, [GAFAM](/gafam-stocks).

FAAMG started from the original abbreviation [FANG](/fang-stocks-fb-amzn), which was begat by CNBC's Jim Cramer. FANG did exclude Apple and Microsoft however included Netflix. The new variation of the biggest tech companies does exclude Netflix in view of its generally small market capitalization compared to the next five companies in FAAMG. Another variation, [FAANG](/faang-stocks), remembers Netflix for place of Microsoft.

## Understanding the FAAMG Stocks

Around 3,000 companies (generally tech companies) trade on the [NASDAQ](/nasdaq), and the [Nasdaq Composite Index](/nasdaqcompositeindex), which demonstrates how the tech sector is faring in the economy. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG) represented 55% of the NASDAQ's year-to-date (YTD) gains as of June 9, 2017.

Furthermore, FAAMG stocks represented 37% of the returns of the [S&P 500 index](/sp500), which tracks the market capitalization of 500 large companies across different industries trading on the [NYSE](/nyse) and NASDAQ.

Every one of the stocks in the FAAMG class is in the main 10, by market capitalization, of the S&P 500 index. Albeit the five stocks are just 1% of the 500 companies in the index, they make up 13% of the market value weighting in the S&P 500. Since the S&P 500 has widely been accepted as the best representation of the US economy, it follows that a collective vertical (or downward) movement in the stock performance of FAAMG will in all likelihood lead to a comparative movement in the index and the market.

For instance, on June 9, 2017, shares of FAAMG companies drooped following a report from Goldman Sachs alerted investors not to involve these stocks as places of refuge. FB, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, and GOOG fell by 3.3%, 3.2%, 3.9%, 2.3%, and 3.4%, individually, toward the finish of the trading day. Thusly, the NASDAQ fell practically 2%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.08%.

FAAMG are termed [growth stocks](/growthstock), generally due to their year-over-year (YOY) consistent and predictable increase in the earnings they create, which converts into expanding stock prices. Retail and institutional investors buy into these stocks straightforwardly or by implication through mutual funds, hedge funds, or [exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs) in a bid to create a gain when the share prices of the tech firms go up.

As of June 9, 2017, while the S&P 500 had gained by 8.5% YTD, the worth of each company that makes FAAMG increased by over 30%, with the exception of MSFT and GOOG, which were up 16.7% and 24% YTD, individually, beating the [market benchmark index](/benchmark). The [13-F filings](/structure 13f) for the principal quarter of 2017 saw outstanding hedge fund managers increase their holdings in FAAMG. Since FAAMG stocks have reliably beaten the market over the years, adding these stocks to a fund's portfolio could increase the possibilities generating a high [alpha](/alpha) for the fund.

In any case, FAAMG stocks have a valuation with strangely low volatility, which is suggestive of the pre-[dotcom crash](/dotcom-bubble) tech stocks. While analysts, strikingly from Goldman Sachs and UBS, feel somewhat doubtful in the proceeded with low volatility of the tech monsters, they concur that these tech stocks in the digital time actually have a lot of room to develop as they dig into new technology adventures in machine learning, big data, cloud computing, social media, video web based, man-made brainpower (AI), blockchain and online business systems.

While Amazon is likewise classified under the "consumer services" sector and "index/specialty dissemination" subsector, it additionally has its [cloud hosting](/cloud-computing) business and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which make it a critical supporter of the technology space.
