# Vega Neutral
## What Is Vega Neutral?

Vega neutral is a method of overseeing risk in options trading by laying out a hedge against the implied volatility of the underlying asset.

Vega is one of the options Greeks along with [delta](/delta), [gamma](/gamma), [rho](/rho) and [theta](/theta). Vega is the Greek that compares with the [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes) price factor for volatility, yet it addresses the sensitivity of the price of an option to volatility and not volatility itself. An options trader will utilize a vega neutral strategy when he accepts that volatility presents a risk to the profits.

## How Vega Neutral Works

Vega neutral isn't quite so well known as the neutral positions for different Greeks. Vega basically lets traders know how a 1% change in the [implied volatility (IV)](/iv) of an option influences the price. So vega is a measure of how sensitive the option premium itself is to volatility. A vega neutral position is a way for options traders to eliminate that sensitivity from their estimations. In the event that a position is vega neutral, it doesn't make or lose money when the implied volatility changes.

## Building a Vega Neutral Portfolio

The vega of a single position is shown on all the major trading platforms. To compute the vega of an options portfolio, you just sum up the vegas of the relative multitude of positions. The vega on short positions ought to be deducted by the vega on long positions (all weighted by the parcels). In a vega neutral portfolio, total vega of the multitude of positions will be zero.

## Illustration of Vega Neutral

For instance, assuming an options trader has 100 heaps of $100 strike calls that have a vega of $10 each, the trader will hope to short a similar underlying product to wipe out $1,000 worth of vega â€” say 200 bunches of $110 strike calls with a vega of $5.

This is distorting it, in any case, as it doesn't consider various expirations or some other intricacies. As a matter of fact, on the off chance that the options have different expiry dates, it becomes challenging to accomplish true vega neutrality in light of the fact that implied volatility will generally not move by similar amount in options with various terms.

The implied volatility term structure shows that most options have a fluctuating IV relying upon the expiration month. To deal with the expiration issue, a time-weighted vega can be utilized with the caveat that it is making a big assumption in that the IV is primarily impacted when to expiry.

Likewise, on the off chance that a trader is seeking to make a vega neutral position with options on various underlying products, they must be exceptionally certain about the degree of correlation between the two underlying products' IV.

Vega neutral strategies are normally endeavoring to profit from the bid-ask spread in implied volatility or the skew between the implied volatility in puts and calls. All things considered, vega neutral is all the more frequently utilized in combination with different Greeks, as in a delta neutral/vega neutral trade or a long gamma/vega neutral trade.
