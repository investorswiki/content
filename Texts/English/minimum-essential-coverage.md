# Least Essential Coverage
## What Is Minimum Essential Coverage?

Least essential coverage is a type of health care coverage policy an individual expected to meet the shared responsibility provision under the Patient Protection and [Affordable Care Act](/affordable-care-act) (ACA). Individuals who lacked least essential coverage recently were hit with a financial penalty. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017 eliminated that penalty and buying health care coverage is as of now not mandatory at the federal level.

Most states followed suit. Nonetheless, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia keep on punishing inhabitants who lack health care coverage under individual order laws.

## Figuring out Minimum Essential Coverage

- An employer-sponsored plan (counting [COBRA](/cobra))
- Any medical coverage plan sold on the [Health Insurance Marketplace](/health care coverage marketplace)
- [Medicare](/medicare) Part A coverage and Medicare Advantage plans
- Most Medicaid coverage
- [Youngsters' Health Insurance Program](/childrens-health care coverage program-chip) (CHIP)
- TRICARE
- Certain plans administered by the Veterans Administration
- Peace Corps volunteer plans

Representatives of organizations whose employer-sponsored plans fail to meet least value criteria determined in the individual order can apply for a premium subsidy at state-run exchanges. Coverage just for vision or dental care, laborers' compensation, coverage for a specific disease or condition, and plans that exclusively offer discounts on medical services don't count as least essential coverage under the ACA.

A few products that help pay for medical services don't qualify, as per the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs). Models include:

- Coverage just for vision care or dental care
- Laborers' compensation
- Accident or disability insurance
- Some Medicaid plans

Starting in the 2019 tax year, tax payers will at this point not be required to pay a penalty on the off chance that they lack least essential coverage. For prior tax years, punishments were calculated in two ways. In the percentage method, just the part of your household income that is over the yearly tax filing requirement is counted. In the per-individual method, you pay just for individuals in your household who don't have insurance coverage. Assuming you had coverage for part of the year, the fee is 1/12 of the annual amount for every month you (or your tax wards) don't have coverage. On the off chance that you're uncovered just 1 or 2 months, you don't need to pay the fee by any means.
