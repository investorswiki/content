# Hedged Tender
## What is Hedged Tender?

A hedged tender is an investment strategy where an investor sells [short](/shortselling) a portion of shares they own in anticipation that not all shares [tendered](/tender) will be accepted. This strategy is utilized to protect against the risk of loss, in case the tender offer doesn't go through. The offer secures in the shareholder's profit regardless of the outcome of the tender offer.

## How a Hedged Tender Works

A hedged tender is a method for balancing the risk that the offering company rejects some or an investor's all's shares that are submitted as part of a [tender offer](/tenderoffer). A tender offer is a proposal from one investor or company to purchase a set number of shares of one more company's stock at a price that is higher than the current market price.

## Hedged Tender as Insurance

A hedged tender strategy, or any type of [hedging](/hedge), is a form of insurance. Hedging in a business setting or in a portfolio is tied in with decreasing or transferring risk. Look at that as a corporation might need to hedge against [currency risk](/currencyrisk), so it chooses to build a factory in another country that it exports its product to.

Investors hedge since they need to protect their assets against a negative market event that makes their assets [depreciate](/deterioration). Hedging might suggest a wary approach, yet a considerable lot of the most aggressive investors use hedging strategies to increase their opportunities for positive returns. By moderating risk in one part of a portfolio, an investor can frequently face more risk challenges, expanding their [absolute returns](/absolutereturn) while seriously endangering less capital in every individual investment.

One more method for seeing it is hedging against investment risk implies decisively utilizing [market instruments](/financialinstrument) to offset the risk of any adverse [price movements](/price-activity). At the end of the day, investors hedge one investment by making another.

## Illustration of a Hedged Tender

A model would be assuming an investor has 5,000 shares of Company ABC. A [acquiring company](/acquirer) then, at that point, submits a tender offer of $100 per share for half of the [target company](/targetfirm) when the shares are worth $80. The investor then, at that point, guesses that in a tender of each of the 5,000 shares the bidder would acknowledge just 2,500 [pro-rata](/pro-rata). Thus, the investor verifies that the best strategy is sell 2,500 shares short after the announcement and when the price of the stock approaches $100. Company ABC then purchases just 2,500 of the original shares at $100. Eventually, the investor has sold all shares at $100 even as the price of the stock drops following fresh insight about the likely transaction.
