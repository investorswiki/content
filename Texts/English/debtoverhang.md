## What Is Debt Overhang?

Debt overhang alludes to a [debt](/debt) burden so large that an entity can't assume extra debt to finance future projects. This incorporates substances that are adequately profitable to have the option to reduce indebtedness over the long haul. A debt overhang effectively deters current investment, since all earnings from new projects would simply go to existing debt holders, passing on minimal incentive and ability for the entity to endeavor to get itself out from underneath the hole.

## Understanding Debt Overhang

At the point when an entity has an unnecessary amount of debt and can't borrow more [capital](/capital), that entity is supposed to be in a debt overhang. The burden is enormous to such an extent that all earnings go straightforwardly to pay off existing debt instead of fund new investment projects, making the potential for default higher. Much of the time, shareholders might be hesitant to support new stock issuances since shareholders might be on the hook for losses.

Debt overhangs additionally apply to sovereign state run administrations. In these cases, the term alludes to a circumstance wherein the debt of a nation surpasses its future capacity to repay it. This can happen from an output gap or economic [underemployment](/underemployment), over and again stopped by the creation of extra credit. A debt overhang can lead to stale growth and a corruption of [living standards](/way of life) from reduced funds to spending in critical areas like healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

On account of the manner in which they influence [balance sheets](/balancesheet) and main concerns, debt overhangs can distress elements in various ways. They can make companies and countries put a delay on additional spending as well as investment. As a matter of fact, they can lead to [underinvestment](/underinvestment_problem). Since they can stunt growth, debt overhangs can make recovery even more troublesome.

There are several methods for escaping a debt overhang. Debtors can sign up for debt cancellation programs to get a portion of or the entirety of their debts forgiven by [creditors](/creditor), nations can default on their debt, companies might go ruined or [bankrupt](/bankruptcy), or existing debt might be repurchased and changed over into equity.

## Special Considerations

A debt overhang can trap companies as a greater proportion of revenues or cash flow basically goes toward servicing its existing debt. This extending [deficit](/deficit) must be filled through incremental debt, which just expands a company's burden.

A debt overhang is especially troublesome as it straps companies meaning to make the most of new opportunities with positive [net present value](/npv) (NPV). Albeit under additional normal conditions, these potential projects would repay themselves over the long haul, an expanding existing debt position in a company could probably switch off would-be investors in the project. Given that the company's debt holders can be sensibly expected to make a case for a portion or the new project's all's profits, the NPV would, in effect, be negative.

To settle the debt overhang in many emerging countries, debt cancellation programs are periodically executed by intergovernmental organizations like the [World Bank](/worldbank) and international organizations, for example, the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF). Programs take care of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zambia. Another program, the Jubilee 2000 campaign, was an international movement by 40 countries, which called for the cancellation of debt of agricultural countries continuously 2000. Albeit the campaign didn't meet its objectives, it was all generally welcomed and was generally viewed as fruitful.
