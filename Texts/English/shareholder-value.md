# Shareholder Value
## What Is Shareholder Value?

Shareholder value is the value delivered to the equity owners of a corporation due to management's ability to increase sales, earnings, and [free cash flow](/freecashflow), which prompts an increase in [dividends](/dividend) and capital gains for the [shareholders](/shareholder).

A company's shareholder value relies upon strategic decisions made by its board of directors and senior management, including the ability to make wise investments and generate a sound [return on invested capital](/returnoninvestmentcapital). In the event that this value is made, particularly over the long term, the share price increases and the company can pay larger cash dividends to shareholders. [Mergers](/consolidation), in particular, will more often than not cause a heavy increase in shareholder value.

Shareholder value can become a hot button issue for corporations, as the creation of wealth for shareholders doesn't constantly or similarly mean value for employees or customers of the corporation.

## Understanding Shareholder Value

Expanding shareholder value increases the total amount in the stockholders' equity section of the [balance sheet](/balancesheet). The balance sheet formula is: assets, minus liabilities, equals stockholders' equity, and stockholders' equity incorporates retained earnings, or the sum of a company's net income, minus cash dividends since commencement.

### How Asset Use Drives Value

Companies raise capital to buy assets and utilize those assets to generate sales or invest in new ventures with a positive expected return. A very much oversaw company expands the utilization of its assets so the firm can operate with a more modest investment in assets.

Assume, for instance, a pipes company utilizes a truck and equipment to complete residential work, and the total cost of these assets is $50,000. The more sales the pipes firm can generate utilizing the truck and the equipment, the more shareholder value the business makes. Important companies are those that can increase earnings with a similar dollar amount of assets.

### Occurrences Where Cash Flow Increases Value

Creating adequate cash inflows to operate the business is likewise an important indicator of shareholder value in light of the fact that the company can operate and increase sales without the need to borrow money or issue more stock. Firms can increase cash flow by rapidly converting inventory and accounts receivable into cash collections.

The rate of cash collection is estimated by [turnover ratios](/turnoverratio), and companies endeavor to increase sales without the need to carry more inventory or increase the average dollar amount of receivables. A high rate of both inventory turnover and accounts-receivable turnover increases shareholder value.

### Figuring in Earnings per Share

Assuming management goes with choices that increase net income every year, the company can either pay a larger [cash dividend](/cashdividend) or hold earnings for use in the business. A company's [earnings for every share (EPS)](/eps) is defined as earnings accessible to common shareholders separated by common stock shares outstanding, and the ratio is a key indicator of a firm's shareholder value. At the point when a company can increase earnings, the ratio increases and investors view the company as more important.

## The Shareholder Value Maximization Myth?

It is commonly perceived that corporate directors and management have a duty to boost shareholder value, particularly for publicly traded companies. In any case, legal decisions recommend that this common wisdom is, as a matter of fact, a reasonable fantasy — there is no legal duty to expand profits in the management of a corporation.

The thought can be followed by and large to the larger than usual impacts of a single obsolete and widely misconstrued managing by the Michigan Supreme Court's 1919 decision in **Dodge v. Passage Motor Co.**, which was about the legal duty of a controlling majority shareholder with respect to a minority shareholder and not tied in with expanding shareholder value. Legal and organizational researchers, for example, Lynn Stout and Jean-Philippe Rob\u00e9 have elaborated on this legend finally.
