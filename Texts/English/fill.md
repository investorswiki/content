## What Is a Fill?

A fill is a [executed](/execution) order. It is the action of finishing or fulfilling an order for a security or commodity. Order execution and reporting fills is a fundamental act in the transacting of stocks, bonds or some other type of security. For instance, in the event that a trader submits a buy request for a stock at $50 and a seller consents to the price, the sale happens, and the order fills. The $50 price is the fill or execution price.

## How Fills Work

There are several types of ways investors might endeavor to fill a securities order. The first and most direct approach is the [market order](/marketorder). In this scenario, an investor trains a broker to buy or sell an investment promptly at the best accessible [current price](/currentprice).

This is typically a default option on an investor's trading platform and highly prone to be executed. A market order is likewise sometimes called an unrestricted order and on average has low commissions, due to the lack of requirements, logistics, and exertion expected to complete it.

## Types of Fill Orders

Conversely, a [limit order](/limitorder) is a guidance to buy or sell a set amount of a financial instrument at a predefined price or better. A limit order may not fill in the event that the price the investor sets isn't accomplished during the period of time in which the order is left open. Limit orders might be canceled in the event that this happens.

Limit orders guarantee that an investor doesn't pass up on an opportunity to buy or sell assuming that the security accomplishes their ideal price target. [Buy limit orders](/buy-limit-order) put a cap on the price above which an investor won't pay, while sell limit orders set a target at the cheapest cost the investor will sell for.

A [stop order](/stoporder) (likewise called a stop-loss order) is a limit order that turns into a market order once the target price is accomplished. For instance, if a [buy stop order](/buystoporder) is placed at a price of $20 (over the current market price), and the stock accomplishes this price, it will consequently purchase determined shares at the next accessible market price (for example $20.05).

In reverse, in the event that a sell stop order is placed for $20, and the stock is declining, when it hits $20, it turns into a sell order at the next accessible market price, which could be $19.98.

## Special Considerations

Investor orders will fill in different ways, in light of the type of order went into a broker's system. While most orders fill naturally when the price is set off or accomplished, on occasion, certain calculations can determine that an order fills over a set period of time as well as founded on the trading volume of a security.

In the event that an order has an expectation or condition, for example, a limit price, the order may just be partially filled. A partial fill, for instance would result from just 200 shares executed at a limit price of $53.00 when the complete order is for 1,000 shares.

This can occur if by some stroke of good luck that more modest number of shares is at any point bid for at that limit price while the order actually stands. Limit order and those with time requirements are subject to partial fills, while market orders are quite often executed in full.

## Highlights
- A fill is the consequence of an order execution to buy or sell securities in the market.
- A fill will report the price(s), timestamps, and volume of an order that has been shipped off the market through a broker or automated trading system.
- Partial fills are orders that poor person been fully executed due to conditions put in on the request, for example, a limit price.
## FAQ
### How Long Does It Take to Fill a Market Order?
For actively traded stocks, market orders are filled very quickly. Unusual high volume can postpone the trade, in any case.
### Do Limit Orders Fill Immediately?
Limit orders are possibly filled if the set price (or better) is accessible. Hence, limit orders possibly fill on the off chance that a security arrives at a certain price. There is no guarantee the order will be filled right away or by any means.
### Is there any good reason why My Pre-Market won't Order Fill?
Pre-market orders probably won't be filled during pre-market trading (4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EST) in the event that there are insufficient shares to meet your order. Large orders on stocks with low volume are more earnestly to fill, especially in pre-market hours.
