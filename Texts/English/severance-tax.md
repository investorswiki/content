# Severance Tax
## What Is Severance Tax?

Severance tax is a state tax forced on the extraction of non-sustainable natural resources that are expected for consumption in different states. These natural resources incorporate like crude oil, condensate and natural gas, coalbed methane, timber, uranium, and carbon dioxide.

## Understanding Severance Tax

Severance tax is charged to resource producers, or anybody with a working or [royalty interest](/royalty-interest) in oil, gas, or mineral operations in the overwhelming states. The tax is calculated in view of either the value or volume of production, however at times states utilize a combination of both. The severance tax is forced to remunerate the states for the loss or "severance" of the non-sustainable source and furthermore to cover the costs associated with removing these resources. Notwithstanding, it is possibly forced while a drilling great can produce over a certain level of natural, still up in the air by the individual state government.

Several tax incentives as [credits](/taxcredit) or lower tax rates are many times permitted in circumstances where the tax rate may be oppressive enough for extractors to fitting and abandon the wells. In this manner, these tax breaks are provided to energize the production and expansion of oil and gas operations.

Royalty owners must pay their pro rata share of oil severance taxes. This [deduction](/tax-deduction) is caught on their month to month royalty owner revenue statement. These owners might be charged severance tax even on the off chance that they don't understand a net profit on their investment. Notwithstanding, state severance taxes are deductible against federal corporate income [tax liabilities](/taxliability). It is important to note that severance tax is not quite the same as [income tax](/incometax), royalty owners producers actually need to pay all federal and state income taxes on oil and gas income notwithstanding severance tax.

Certain wells might be exempt from severance tax in view of the amount they produce. Various states have various rules. For instance, in Colorado, an oil well that produces under an average of 15 barrels each producing day or a gas well that produces under an average of 90,000 cubic feet each producing day is exempt from this tax.

Pennsylvania's Senate passed a budget that incorporates, interestingly, a severance tax on natural gas produced inside the state. The state actually stays the main major gas-producing state in the country that doesn't tax production, starting around 2020. All things considered, it imposes a for every well [impact fee](/impact_fees), charging an annual fee to all [unconventional](/uncoventional-oil) (for example shale) wells. Gas companies pay the impact fee for each well they drill, which is not normal for the severance tax, which gas companies pay in view of how much gas is produced.

Severance taxes accounts for a tiny percentage of overall government revenue â€” with the exception of a couple of resource-rich states, like North Dakota and Wyoming.
