# Telefile
## What Was Telefile?

Telefile was a service made by the federal government and some state governments that permitted taxpayers to file their taxes via telephone.

The federal government's Telefile system was given by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) from 1997 to 2005. Telefile permitted taxpayers filing IRS form [1040EZ](/1040ez) to telephone in their tax returns with a touch-tone telephone. The IRS ended the Telefile program because of the overall migration to electronically filed tax returns.

A considerable lot of the state Telefile systems have been discontinued. A number of states have Telefile services for limited purposes. Texas, for instance, has a Telefile number for sales tax filing requirements, yet it tends to be utilized simply by businesses with zero sales to report.

## How the Federal Telefile Worked

Telefile is as of now not in place and people can never again file their federal tax forms via telephone.

The IRS keeps a telephone help system right up to the present day however the administrators are there to respond to questions, not to acknowledge your tax return.

The IRS made Telefile available to people who filed form 1040EZ. Until the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the 1040EZ was the abbreviated variant of the IRS's standard Form 1040 (the standard form for income tax). Beginning around 2017, the 1040EZ form has been discontinued.

Form 1040EZ was a condensed rendition of Form 1040, intended to furnish taxpayers with essential tax circumstances a fast and simple method for filing their income taxes. To utilize the form, a taxpayer expected to have annual taxable income of under $100,000, under $1,500 of interest income, and have guaranteed no wards.

Eligible taxpayers naturally received the federal Telefile package in the mail.

## State Telefile Systems

Many states additionally permitted telefiling, following the lead of the federal government. Their processes and technology were generally equivalent to those utilized by the IRS.

A few states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, keep on permitting the filing of business taxes by telephone.

## Why Is Telefile No Longer Available?

In the eight years the IRS permitted telefiling, it was introduced as a helpful service for [taxpayers](/taxpayer) with simple tax returns. The Telefile service worked by allowing taxpayers to dial the numbers on their tax return straightforwardly into the telephone to report their [income](/income). It was attainable just for the most clear returns.

The IRS replaced Telefile with [electronic filing](/efile) in 2005.

## Who Was Eligible for Telefile?

In the event that you are interested whether your state actually offers a telefiling system, go to the state revenue, treasury, or tax authority website, or search your state's name and "telefile" in an internet web search tool.

E-filing permits people to present their tax returns over the internet utilizing IRS pre-supported tax arrangement software. Throughout the course of recent years, e-filing has increased in prominence and is currently the most common way people file taxes.

Past the convenience for filers of having the option to file from the comfort of their home, e-filing saves the IRS time and money by communicating tax data straightforwardly into the organization's PCs. This is an improvement over the old system where people would mail their returns straightforwardly to the taxing authority or have a preparer do as such.

E-filing has fundamentally decreased the possibility of keying and input errors and rates up the cycle significantly.

Another benefit is that while e-filing, the tax filer gets a confirmation or dismissal notice in no less than 24 hours of communicating the electronic reports. That confirmation is proof that the IRS received the [tax return](/1040) and it is in process. A dismissal is a notice to the taxpayer that their form has not been accepted by the IRS. Generally speaking, this is due to a clear box or some other clear mistake that can be remedied and refiled.

All taxpayers can now utilize the IRS Free File site to download the current forms assuming they decide to do their own taxes. Likewise, any taxpayer whose [adjusted gross income](/agi) in 2021 was $73,000 or less can access their decision of professional tax readiness services that partner with the IRS from the Free File site. Services accessed from the site are free for federal filing, albeit a fee might be charged for filing your state return.
