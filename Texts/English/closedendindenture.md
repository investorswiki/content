# Closed-End Indenture
## What Is a Closed-End Indenture?

The term closed-end indenture alludes to a [bond](/bond) contract that guarantees that the [collateral](/collateral) used to secure the bond can't be utilized again to support another bond issue. A [indentur](/indenture)e is a legal and binding provision for the most part associated with bond agreements, real estate, or bankruptcy cases.

A closed-end indenture makes the bond even safer for the [investor](/investor). Summoning the indenture occurs assuming that the issuer defaults on the bond.

## How Closed-End Indentures Work

Bonds are generally viewed as among the most secure investment options that anyone could hope to find to investors. They are conservative investments that give investors stability and [income](/income). They address loans advanced by the investor to the bond issuer — the issuer vows to repay the investor the [principal](/principal) balance invested alongside any [interest](/interest) payments by a predefined date. Put basically, a bond is a [IOU](/iou) that the issuer provides for the investor.

All bonds have contracts, called [indentures](/indenture), illustrating the terms of the bond. Indentures are legally binding and unconditional, and the penalty for breaking them is extreme. A closed-end indenture is a clause that includes the utilization of collateral that backs the bond. This type of indenture is a small however urgent insight about a bond that influences the [risks](/risk) to the bond for both the [issuer](/issuer) and investor. As referenced over, the collateral utilized can't be utilized to issue any new bonds.

Closed-end indentures are possibly summoned if the bond issuer [defaults](/default2), and that means that indenture is significant in a situation of financial instability for the bond issuer. On the off chance that the bond issuer defaults, a closed-end indenture guarantees the [bondholders](/bondholder) will have the main claims on the collateral, making their bonds the most senior security. Less claims on the collateral mean more safety for the bondholder.

## Special Considerations

The [yield-to-maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) rate isn't listed in that frame of mind of the bond since it is assumed to be the predominant [market](/market) [interest rate](/interestrate) at the time the bond is issued. Terms contained in the indenture include:

- **The face value**: Also known as the [par value](/parvalue), this is the ostensible value of a security. For bonds, it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity, generally $1,000.
- **The interest rate or coupon rate**: This is the yield paid by a fixed-income security.
- **Interest payment date**: This is a part of the total loan contract which addresses the dollar amount required to pay the interest cost of the loan for the payment period.
- **The maturity date**: The day the borrower is required to repay the full amount of the outstanding principal plus any applicable interest to the lender. Nonpayment at maturity might comprise a default.
- **The name of the bond trustee**: A financial institution that directs the bond. It has both trust and fiduciary powers allowed by an issuer to uphold the terms of the indenture.
- **Bond and early reclamation terms**: These remember the return of an investor's principal for a fixed-income security.
- **Collateral**: A [asset](/asset) offered by a borrower to a lender to secure a [loan](/loan). Assuming the borrower stops making the guaranteed loan payments, the lender can hold onto the collateral to recover its losses. Collateral is either an open-end indenture or a closed-end indenture.

## Closed-End Indentures versus Open-End Indentures

Both closed-end or open-end indentures might be summoned assuming the issuer of the security defaults. Yet, there is a slight difference between these two clauses. An open-end indenture is one in which a single piece of collateral can back more than one bond. This means an open-end indenture bond could have quite a few bonds with a similar collateral used to back up the [security](/security), so in the event of a default, an investor might have no possibility to claim that collateral assuming that another investor has a senior claim on the collateral.

A less stable bond issuer has more incentive to incorporate an open-end indenture term in the bond offering. An issuer who is stable has more confidence that they won't default and can in this way add a closed-end indenture in the bond's terms. Indenture can be utilized by an investor — alongside interest rate and time to maturity — to survey risk and settle on a conclusion about investing in a specific bond issue.

## Features
- A closed-end indenture guarantees that a bond's collateral isn't utilized to support another bond issue.
- In the event of default, this indenture's collateral would pay back those bondholders.
- Due to this restriction on the utilization of collateral, closed-end indentures are comparatively safer.
