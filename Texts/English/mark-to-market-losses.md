# Mark-To-Market Losses
## What Are Mark-To-Market Losses?

[Mark-to-market](/marktomarket) losses are losses produced through an accounting entry as opposed to the real sale of a security. Mark-to-market losses can happen when financial instruments held are valued at the [current market value](/cmv). On the off chance that a security was purchased at a certain price and the [market price](/market-price) later fell, the holder would have a [unrealized loss](/unrealizedloss), and marking the security down to the new market price would bring about the mark-to-market loss. Mark-to-market accounting is part of the concept of [fair value](/fairvalue) accounting, which endeavors to give investors more transparent and pertinent data.

## Figuring out Mark-To-Market Losses

Mark-to-market is intended to give the current market value of a company's assets by contrasting the value of the assets with the asset's value under current market conditions. Numerous assets vary in value, and occasionally, corporations must revalue their assets given the changing market conditions. Instances of these assets that have market-based prices incorporate stocks, bonds, residential homes, and commercial real estate.

Mark-to-market assists with showing a company's current financial condition inside the background of current market conditions. Subsequently, mark-to-market can frequently give a more accurate measurement or valuation of a company's assets and investments.

Mark-to-market is an accounting method that stands conversely, with [historical cost](/historical-cost) accounting, which would utilize the asset's [original cost](/originalcost) to compute its valuation. At the end of the day, historical cost would permit a bank or company to keep up with similar value for an asset for its whole helpful life. In any case, assets that are valued utilizing market-based pricing will quite often change in value. These assets don't keep up with a similar value as their original purchase price, which makes mark-to-market important since it revalues the assets at current prices. Tragically, in the event that an asset's price diminished since the original purchase, the company or bank would have to record a mark-to-market loss.

## Mark-to-Market Accounting

Mark-to-market, as an accounting concept, has been represented by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)](/fasb), which lays out the accounting and financial reporting standards for corporations and nonprofit organizations in the United States. FASB issues its standards by means of the board's different statements.

Despite the fact that there are numerous FASB statements of interest to companies, SFAS 157-Fair Value Measurements holds the most consideration of auditors and accountants. SFAS 157 gives a definition of "fair value" and how to measure it as per [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap).

Fair value, in theory, is equivalent to the current market price of an asset. As per SFAS 157, the fair value of an asset (as well as liability) is "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."

Such assets fall under [Level 1](/level1_assets) of the hierarchy made by the FASB. Level 1 assets are assets that have a dependable, transparent, fair market value, which are effectively perceptible. Stocks, bonds, and funds containing a basket of securities would be remembered for Level 1 since the assets can undoubtedly have a mark-to-market component for laying out its fair market value.

On the off chance that the market values of securities in a portfolio fall, mark-to-market losses would need to be recorded even in the event that they were not sold. The predominant values at measurement date would be utilized to mark the securities.

Other FASB statements include:

- SFAS 115 - Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
- SFAS 130 - Reporting Other Comprehensive Income
- SFAS 133 - Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
- SFAS 155 - Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

## Market-To-Market Losses During Crises

The purpose of the mark-to-market methodology is to provide investors with a more accurate image of the value of a company's assets. During normal economic times, the accounting rule is observed regularly with practically no issues.

In any case, during the profundities of the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) in 2008-2009, mark-to-market accounting experienced harsh criticism. Banks, investment funds, and other financial institutions held mortgages as well as [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS), which are a basket of mortgage loans sold to investors as a fund. These securities were held on bank balance sheets yet couldn't be valued as expected in light of the fact that the housing market had slumped.

Since there was no market for these assets any longer, their prices dove. Also, since financial institutions couldn't sell the assets, which were thought of as toxic by then, bank balance sheets took on major financial losses when they needed to mark-to-market the assets at the current market prices.

It worked out that banks and private equity firms that were accused to changing degrees were incredibly hesitant to mark their holdings to market. They held out as long as they could, as it was to their greatest advantage to do as such (their positions and compensation were in question), however eventually, the billions of dollars worth of [subprime mortgage loans](/subprime_mortgage) and securities were revalued. The mark-to-market losses prompted [write-downs](/writedown) by banks, meaning the assets were revalued at fair value leading to recorded losses for banks, which totaled almost $2 trillion. The outcome was financial and economic chaos.

It's important to note that market-based measurements of assets don't necessarily mirror the true value of the asset assuming the price is fluctuating fiercely. Likewise, in times of [illiquidity](/illiquid)- significance there are not many purchasers or sellers-there isn't any market or buying interest for these assets, which pushes down the prices even further fueling the mark-to-market losses.

## Real World Example of Market-To-Market Losses

The 2008 and 2009 financial crisis sent the equity and real estate markets into free fall. Banks needed to revalue their books to mirror the current prices of their assets around then.

The mark-to-market losses that followed was critical. State Street Bank is an institutional investment bank. In January 2009, the bank reported unrealized mark-to-market losses of $6.3 billion for their investment portfolio, which was an increase of $3.0 billion in mark-to-market losses recorded during their previous earnings report on September 30, 2008.

State Street Chief Executive Ron Logue (in 2009), in his meeting with Reuters, said that the bank's recent stock price decline was linked "to the story of unrealized investment losses, which is so overwhelming." Mr. Logue went onto to say that the issues originated from a lack of liquidity in the market brought about by the financial crisis and that terrible credit or terrible loans were not to fault.
