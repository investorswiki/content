# All-In Coverage
## What Is All-In Coverage?

All-in coverage is a type of [insurance coverage](/insurance-coverage) that applies to communally involved highlights in residential multi-family buildings as well as the structures inside the individual units. All-in coverage, likewise called all-inclusive coverage, is utilized for condominiums (or condos), a type of residential property where a few common components, like the doorway or light fixtures, are utilized by all residents of the building.

## Understanding All-In Coverage

All-in coverage offers the broadest coverage with regards to insuring a condominium building. It covers the structure of the building, from highlights that can be utilized by all the residents to the elements just accessible in the individual units. This type of coverage is purchased by the condominium association and is outlined in the association's rules and [covenants](/contract).

All-in condo insurance gives a greater level of interior coverage for condominium owners. In the event that a condo's interior is harmed by fire, for instance, the condo local area's all-in insurance policy would cover a considerable lot of its interior components. All-in condo insurance covers fixtures, installations, and augmentations to the interior surfaces of your walls, floors, and ceilings. You'd just need a limited amount of individual homeowners insurance under a condo local area's all-in insurance master policy.

All-in coverage applies to common areas as well as anything that is utilized predominately by a condominium resident. Owners of individual condo units are as yet encouraged to purchase their own insurance to cover damages to anything from within their own unit that isn't part of the original design and format plan, like increments or rebuilds, as well as furniture, clothing, and other personal things alluded to as items.

## All-In Coverage versus Other Coverage Types

As opposed to pick all-in coverage, a condominium association can instead decide to purchase single entity coverage or bare walls coverage. [Single entity coverage](/single-entity-coverage) applies to all property, including things in individual units. It doesn't have any significant bearing to the personal things, like PCs and clothing, of the individual condo residents, and applies to no improvements made to the condo unit. This type of insurance is the most common property insurance purchased by condominium associations.

[Bare walls coverage](/bare-walls-coverage) is the most limited type of coverage that a condominium association can decide to purchase. It just applies to the common areas of the condo, like the entrance, and covers nothing inside the individual units, like the fixtures, installations, and apparatuses. A bare walls-in policy centers around the real structure of the condo â€” the outside, roofing, framing, wiring, piping, insulation, and the drywall itself.
