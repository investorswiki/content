# Exercise Limit
## What Is an Exercise Limit?

An exercise limit is a restriction placed on the number of [option](/optionscontract) contracts of a single class that any one person or company can [exercise](/exercise) inside a fixed time span like five business days. This limit is placed with the goal that nobody person or company can corner or significantly impact the options market or the market in the underlying security.

Exercise limits are connected with [position limits](/positionlimit) since practicing call options gives ownership or control to the underlying asset. These restrictions assist with keeping markets fair and efficient. The limit itself will fluctuate depending on the [volume](/volume) of the underlying asset and the number of shares outstanding on account of equity options.

## Understanding Exercise Limits

Exercise limits are laid out by the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA), an independent agency that controls registered brokers and [broker-dealer](/broker-dealer) organizations across the United States. Its primary goal is to shield investors and the public from corporate fraud. FINRA has five methods for guaranteeing a fair marketplace:

- Authorizing regulations to forestall offense
- Utilizing technology to forestall fraud
- Restraining people and firms that abuse the guidelines
- Giving education and data to investors
- Settling questions

FINRA puts option exercise limits in place to forestall any market [manipulation](/manipulation), including [corners](/corneramarket) and crushes, in underlying securities markets, and to keep away from disturbances in options markets that are illiquid. These limits forbid an account, along with some other accounts controlled by a similar entity, from cumulatively practicing in excess of a pre-decided number of options contracts associated with a specific underlying security.

In the event that exercise limits were not in place, traders could purchase and exercise enough [call options](/calloption) to possess enough of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) and control the majority of the underlying market. For example, a [bad actor](/regulationd) in the stock market could cause the takeover of a company and its controlling votes through the exercise of options alone. In commodities markets, it could permit a troublemaker to corner the market and misleadingly blow up the price of products like silver, crude oil, or soybeans.

The exercise of a long option generally brings about the [assignment ](/assignment)of a short options position while upsetting [illiquid](/illiquid) options markets. This means that numerous clueless options essayists will out of nowhere be placed in long or short positions in the underlying stock. As these traders try to exit or restore their prior positions, the prices of the options contracts, being illiquid, could swing fiercely.

## Exercise Limits versus Position Limits

FINRA implements position limits along with exercise limits on options contracts to guarantee that markets stay fair for all gatherings included. A position limit is a level of ownership that is foreordained by [exchanges](/exchange) or regulators. It limits the number of shares or contracts that traders or firms are able to possess. Albeit both the exercise and position limits try to cap how big of a position an entity has, they each control various things.

It is conceivable that an exercise limit is penetrated without a position limit being penetrated since an exercise limit is cumulative north of a five-day period. A trader could remain below their position limit by buying contracts consistently, practicing them, and afterward buying more contracts up to their position limit once more. By doing this, they aren't disregarding position limits, however they might abuse exercise limits when all their exercised positions are counted.

## Illustration of Exercise Limits

Options exchanges give a position and exercise limit table to which traders can allude. For instance, copper options on the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) have a five-day exercise limit of 5,000 contracts. This means no person or group can exercise in excess of 5,000 copper contracts over any five-day period.

For equity options on stocks, the exercise limit frequently relies upon the volume and [liquidity](/liquidity) of the underlying security. It tends to be changed pending survey by the exchange and the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC).
