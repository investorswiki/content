# Accumulation Unit
## What Is an Accumulation Unit?

An accumulation unit is a measurement of the value invested in a variable [annuity](/annuity) account during the accumulation period or a sort of investment where a unit trust's income is reinvested into the trust.

## How an Accumulation Unit Works

An accumulation unit can allude to one of two things:

1) In the case of a variable annuity, it is a measurement of the value invested in the account during the [accumulation](/accumulation) period of the contract. As an investor offers more funds to an annuity account, they gather more units. These units are then utilized as the basis for distributions when the investor needs to begin making withdrawals.

2) In the case of a unit [trust](/trust), an accumulation unit is a sort of investment wherein the income of the trust isn't paid out as cash to the investor and is rather reinvested into the trust straightforwardly.

Accumulation units, on account of a variable annuity, are utilized to measure the value of contributions by the annuitant precisely. In times when the variable annuity's investments fall, a fixed level of funding will buy more accumulation units than when the [securities](/investment-securities) are all the more exceptionally priced, just as investors are able to buy a bigger number of shares of less expensive stock than they container of more costly stock with a similar amount of currency.

Accumulation units inside a unit trust can be reinvested once more into the trust by spiking the unit price, or, in all likelihood by giving more units to investors. Regardless, the investor can reinvest their share of profits once again into the trust.

In this scenario, an investor is taking a gander at the option of income units versus accumulation units. Income units give interest or dividend income straightforwardly to the investor, frequently at standard stretches. Accumulation units, conversely, are intended to support the value of the fund, so any income produced is reinvested straightforwardly into the fund.

Investors ought to focus on their objectives while choosing accumulation or income units. These incorporate conclusions of whether investors need income right away, or on the other hand if not, whether the accumulated interest will better serve the investor later on.

Investors can change starting with one unit type then onto the next, and generally do as such. For example, when one methodologies retirement and necessities to reinforce any [pension](/pensionplan) payments they might receive, it might check out to move from accumulation to income units. There might be fees associated with making changes, notwithstanding, so talking with an advisor prior to rolling out an improvement is really smart.
