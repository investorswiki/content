# All-Pay Auction
## What is an All-Pay Auction

An all-pay [auction](/auction) is an auction that requires all bidding participants pay their bid amount, whether or not they have placed the highest bid.

## BREAKING DOWN All-Pay Auction

An all-pay auction game theory spins around the possibility of an auction where all participants are putting silent [bids](/bid) with the information that they will be required to pay even on the off chance that theirs isn't the triumphant bid. It is common in these situations for bidders to overbid, or place offers that are higher than the intrinsic value of the thing they are bidding on, in order to secure the triumphant bid. Ordinarily, even the bidders who win the thing are spending undeniably more than the thing is worth. In a standard auction, just the triumphant bidder would be required to make payment. All losing bidders would be free from financial obligation.

Several types of all-pay auctions exist; the most common form is a wager. During a pool, an item is placed up for bid. Every person pays to bid on the thing, which as a rule includes buying a pool ticket. Only one of the ticket holders, or bidders, will win the thing.

Essentially, a [lottery](/lottery) is one more form of an all-pay auction since every person who buys a lottery ticket is paying for a chance to win. In any case, dissimilar to the standard all-pay auction, a few lotteries award more than one [winner](/winnerscurse).

## What is an Absolute Auction

A [absolute auction](/absolute-auction) is a bidding cycle in which there is just one victor. The victor is the bidder who placed the highest bid on the thing. There are no base bids or reserve prices on absolute auctions; all in all, there is no base amount due to continue with the sale. This allows the opportunity for a bidder to walk away with a thing that is worth definitely more than it cost them to secure.

There are several types of absolute auctions. The most common form is the one that happens after a property has been [foreclosed](/dispossession) on. The bidder might actually get a property for a much lower price than the property is worth.

Nonetheless, there are potential risks implied in such transactions. Sometimes these properties accompany weighty tax demands. There is likewise the possibility that these properties have supported huge harm or require broad repairs before being safe to possess or exchange. Additionally, large numbers of these types of auctions occur without having looked at anything beforehand, implying that the bidder has not gotten an opportunity to inspect the property for themselves.
