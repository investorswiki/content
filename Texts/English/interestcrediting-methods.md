# Interest-Crediting Methods
## What Are Interest-Crediting Methods?

An interest-crediting method determines how interest changes to a fixed index annuity (FIA) are estimated. The interest-crediting method picked measures the amount of interest that the annuity holder can receive throughout a specific time period.

[Annuity](/annuity) contracts have a number of provisions that affect how interest is treated. Most contacts incorporate a combination of caps (maximum interest permitted), participation rates (fraction of interest credited to the contract) and spreads. These limit the upside potential of increases in index value.

## Understanding Interest-Crediting Methods

[Indexed annuities](/indexedannuity) return cash flows linked to the performance of an equity index, like the S&P 500 index, but with a cap on the maximum return that will be credited. In a point-to-point interest-crediting method, any increase in the value of an index is calculated from two points in time. This is the simplest interest-crediting method to calculate, but it may not furnish an annuity contract holder with the most benefit. For instance, in the event that an index was valued at 1,000 at the beginning of the time period and increased to 1,150 by and by, the point-to-point method would call this a 15 percent increase (150/1000 x 100). In the event that the index diminishes in value no interest will be added to the contract, though the contract won't lose its value.

A monthly average method takes the value of the index at the finish of every month and averages them. This is pretty much as simple as summing up all of the month's end values and separating by twelve. On the off chance that, for instance, an index started the year at 1,000 and the average index value was 1,200, then the monthly average would be 20 percent (200/1,000 x 100). This method might be considered during volatile markets.

The monthly sum method takes the percentage increase or lessening in the index every month and sums them up. The index might go into positive territory or fall into negative territory from one month to another. On the off chance that the percentages are added together and come out positive, the interest will be credited to the contract. This method is the most sensitive to volatility.

## Interest-Crediting Method Types

Interest-crediting methods vary for other types of annuities. Normal fixed annuities credit interest at a rate that is linked to the [T-bills rate](/treasurybill). Fixed indexed annuities, then again, credit interest utilizing formulas in light of changes in specific indexes. The crediting method determines how much interest is credited to the annuity. The rate and frequency of the credits rely on the terms and conditions of FIA contract.

A portion of those alternative interest-crediting methods utilized by insurance agency include:

- Annual point-to-point averaging
- Biennial point-to-point averaging
- Monthly point-to-point averaging
- Daily averaging/monthly averaging
- Hindsight index strategy monthly averaging

## Highlights
- For indexed annuities, the crediting method requires a formula that might take a monthly average of a stock index's price movements.
- Interest crediting methods are ways to deal with determining the cash flows due to annuitants on an indexed annuity.
- Standard fixed annuities credit annuitants at a fixed rate linked to treasury securities issued by the government.
