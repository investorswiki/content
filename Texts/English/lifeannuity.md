# Life Annuity
## What Is a Life Annuity?

The term life [annuity](/annuity) alludes to a financial product that includes a predetermined periodic payout amount until the death of the annuity proprietor — called the [annuitant](/annuitant). An annuitant regularly pays into the annuity periodically when they are as yet working. Annuitants may likewise buy the annuity product in one large, lump-sum purchase — normally at retirement. Life annuities are normally used to give guaranteed or potentially supplemental retirement income that can't be outlasted.

## How a Life Annuity Works

Life annuities are [insurance](/insurance) or investment products that give the [beneficiary](/beneficiary) with fixed payments at normal stretches — either month to month, quarterly, annually, or semi-annually. Life annuities, otherwise called lifetime annuities, are generally sold by insurance companies. They basically act as longevity insurance, as the risk of outlasting one's savings is given to the annuity issuer or provider.

Life annuities come in two unique phases. The first is the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase) or deferral stage. This is the period when the buyer funds their annuity with [premiums](/premium) or with a [lump-sum](/lump-sum-payment) payment. The subsequent stage is the distribution or the [annuitization](/annuitization) phase. During this period, the issuer or insurance company makes normal payments to the annuitant.

When funded and enacted, the annuity makes periodic payouts to the annuitant, hence giving a solid source of income. The issuer typically stops making periodic payments assuming the annuitant passes on or on the other hand on the off chance that another triggering event happens to close the annuity. Be that as it may, these payments might proceed to the annuitant's [estate](/estate) or beneficiary on the off chance that the annuitant had purchased a [rider](/rider) or other option on the annuity.

Payment stretches rely upon the specific requirements of the annuitant or their tax conditions. Numerous retired people fund a life annuity to match their recurring housing costs — [mortgage](/mortgage) or lease — as well as some other costs, including assisted living, medical care, insurance premiums, and medical expenses.

While life annuities are frequently used to give or supplement retirement income, they are likewise utilized as a payment method in structured settlements and for lottery victors. For example, on the off chance that somebody wins a claim, they might be furnished with a series of fixed, normal payments to the beneficiary. Lottery victors might opt to take a lottery annuity instead of a fixed, lump-sum when they win large jackpots. These payouts give customary payments annually over a certain number of years. For instance, a Mega Millions [jackpot](/jackpot) victor can decide to take 30 payments — one paid out immediately. The excess payments are distributed annually for the next 29 years.
