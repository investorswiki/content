# Market Out Clause
## What Is a Market Out Clause?

A market out clause is a limitation in a [underwriting agreement](/underwriting-agreement) that permits the [underwriter](/underwriter) to cancel the agreement without penalty. A market out clause can be activated for specific reasons, for example, souring market conditions or essentially on the grounds that the underwriter is experiencing issues in selling the company's stock. Nonetheless, however the reasons can be shifted, they must be noted in the market out clause.

## Figuring out a Market Out Clause

A market out clause is tied in with lessening an underwriter's risks in a firm commitment underwriting. The underwriter for an IPO contracts with the responsible company to market and sell the company's stock to investors in the [primary market](/primarymarket). With a firm commitment underwriting, the underwriter consents to expect all [inventory](/inventory) risk and buy all securities for a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) straight from the issuer to sell to the public.

Of course, this involves a fair amount of risk coming about because of overhype and other factors. Underwriters can experience a major financial loss by being forced to guarantee an offering that it later discovers might have little interest to investors - either as a result of conditions inside the responsible company or due to declining market conditions. Subsequently, a market out clause is generally conjured when the market has run into a difficult time or other IPOs have failed to meet expectations.

A market out clause can likewise permit the underwriting syndicate to opt-out of the underwriting agreement prior to the initial public offering (IPO) if, for instance, trading in the company's securities is suspended, a material change adversely influences the issuer or other such events make it unreasonable for the securities to be sold at the agreed-upon price.

Counsel for a responsible company that is setting up an IPO underwriting agreement must carefully audit the conditions in the agreement that will permit the market out clause to be activated. An overly broad market out clause will effectively nullify the concept of a [firm commitment](/firmcommitment) underwriting. Such an overreaching clause will permit an underwriter to cancel the underwriting agreement for essentially any explanation, effectively putting all the risk on the responsible company.
