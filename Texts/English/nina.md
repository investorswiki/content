# No Income/No Asset Mortgage (NINA)
## What Is a No Income/No Asset (NINA) Mortgage?

No Income/No Asset mortgages are a type of decreased documentation [mortgage](/mortgage) program where the lender doesn't need the borrower to reveal income or assets as part of loan calculations. Be that as it may, the lender checks the borrower's employment status prior to giving the loan.

This type of loan can make the most sense for gig workers, self-employed individuals, and different professionals whose kinds of revenue are hard to check or reliably document.

Following the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, NINA loans have become harder to stopped by as financial firms have fixed their lending criteria.

## Understanding No Income/No Asset Mortgages

No Income/No Asset (NINA) mortgages may be utilized by borrowers who would rather not, or cannot give, financial information. This type of loan is instead approved on a declaration that affirms the borrower can afford the loan payments. NINA loans usually fall into the [Alt-A](/alt-a) classification of loans, with a borrower risk profile in the middle between [prime](/prime) and [subprime](/subprime).

NINA loans have a higher [interest](/interest) rate than a prime mortgage since homebuyers who don't uncover financial data are more inclined to default.

NINA loans are also known as [No Doc](/nodocmortgage) mortgages. Be that as it may, an actual No Doc loan doesn't need the borrower to demonstrate their employment status in any capacity. A NINA loan will, although with far looser criteria than a standard loan. Because of these loose criteria, NINA mortgages and similar products are at times known as [liar loans](/liar_loan).

## NINA versus NINJA Loans

The slang term [NINJA loan](/ninja-loan) applies to credit extended to a borrower with no income, no job, and no assets. With this type of loan, the bank approves the mortgage based exclusively on the borrower's credit score.

Not at all like a NINA loan, a NINJA loan can be issued to an individual with no income at all. NINJA loans have become less continuous in the wake of the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, as the government executed new regulations to further develop standard lending practices.

## Risks of No Income/No Asset Mortgages

In certain circumstances, a borrower may be tempted to utilize a NINA loan to obtain a mortgage that is outside of their income's reach. A borrower ought to never be persuaded by a lender or [mortgage broker](/mortgagebroker) to utilize a NINA loan to obtain a mortgage in the event that they can not reasonably repay. Also, more traditional mortgages are reasonably available at a lower interest rate.

NINA loans played a job in the [subprime mortgage](/subprime_mortgage) crisis. Predatory lenders utilized this type of loan to approve mortgages that in any case wouldn't qualify. Subsequently, many homebuyers who took out NINA mortgages in the mid-late 2000s ended up defaulting on their loans.

As reported by the **New York Times** in November 2007, Freddie Mac announced it was marking down the value of its as of late issued loans by a total of $1.2 billion. This mark-down was partly due to borrowers having failed to make payments on their NINA loans. The lending organization's CFO, Anthony S. Piszel, refered to the issue because of settled for the status quo "across the board."
