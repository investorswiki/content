## What Is a Medallion Signature Guarantee?

A medallion signature guarantee is one of several special certification stamps that guarantees a signature that approves a [transfer](/transfer) of securities is valid. Gatherings will generally require a medallion signature guarantee when an owner needs to sell or transfer securities, like stocks or [bonds](/bond), held in physical certificate form. On the off chance that an owner holds securities through a [broker](/broker), they won't have to get a signature guarantee to sell or transfer the securities.

## How Medallion Signature Guarantees Work

To give a Medallion signature guarantee, an institution must be a member of one of three Medallion signature guarantee programs: the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program, and the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program.

Typically, you can get a Medallion signature guarantee at a financial institution where you are as of now a customer. The bank might survey a small charge for this service.

## Special Considerations

A medallion signature guarantee frequently relates with a [share certificate](/share-certificate). A share certificate (or stock certificate) is a written document that fills in as legal proof of ownership of a set number of a company's shares.

This is conversely, with possessing a bond, a form of debt instrument, in which a separate party loans money to a company or the government. Key information on a share certificate generally incorporates the accompanying:

- Certificate number
- Company name and registration number
- [Shareholder](/shareholder) name and address
- Number of shares possessed
- [Class of shares](/class)
- Issue date of shares
- Amount paid (or treated as paid) on the shares

Shares might be issued in separate classes. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway offers stockholders Class A (BRK.A) and Class B (BRK.B) shares. A number of other notable companies have double class structures, like Ford (F), Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Groupon (GRPN). In the mean time, a few companies have various share classes â€” where Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG) has three classes of shares.

Each class offers various rights to the stockholder as to [dividends](/profit) and voting options. On occasion the owner of a stock certificate can give a proxy to someone else to permit them to vote with expressed shares on issues of company policy.

On the off chance that a share certificate is harmed, lost, or taken, the company might issue a replacement certificate. In such a case, the shareholder must return the harmed document. Share certificates may either be registered or in bearer form. A bearer share certificate qualifies the holder for exercise all legal rights associated with the stock.

Today individual investors rarely have physical possession of their share certificates, inclining toward electronic records all things being equal.
