## What Is Assessable Capital Stock?

Assessable capital stock is [capital stock](/capitalstock) that could subject shareholders to liabilities above what they paid for their shares. Assessable capital stock stands as opposed to [non-assessable](/nonassessablestock) capital stock, where shareholders can lose the amount they invested.

Holders of assessable shares could need to give extra funding at whatever point a company needs more capital or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. Assessable capital stock, be that as it may, is not generally issued as all stock is presently non-assessable.

## Grasping Assessable Capital Stock

At the point when investors purchase [stocks](/stock) these days, the main risk they face is the loss of the amount they invest. For instance, assuming an investor purchases $1,000 worth of Company ABC stock and the company's share price tumbles to zero, their total and just amount of loss would be $1,000. This is non-assessable stock, meaning that investors can't be held at risk for more than the price of their investment.

Interestingly, assessable capital stock holds the shareholder to [liabilities](/liability) over the amount they have invested, up to the face value of their shares.

Assessable capital stock is a type of [assessable stock](/assessablestock) that is issued as part of a primary offering. This class of equities would be issued to investors by companies at a discount to [face value](/facevalue) with the comprehension that the company might return to investors for more money sometime in the future.

For instance, assuming Company ABC's stock was trading at $20, ABC would offer the stock to certain investors at a discount for $15; notwithstanding, this would accompany the expectation that ABC might return to them with a request for additional funds, up to the face value of the stock. This is normally alluded to as the investors being held to a call during [insolvency](/insolvency) and [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) procedures or when a company needs extra capital to fund growth or make an acquisition.

Assessable capital stocks were a common type of stock issuance in the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century yet never again exist. As protections are presently non-assessable, companies that need to raise extra capital might issue extra stock or bonds all things considered. During insolvency, a company's assets are sold off and [creditors](/lender) are paid once again arranged by [seniority](/seniorsecurity). Those that are not paid back in light of the fact that the assets don't cover all liabilities experience a loss.

## Risks of Assessable Stock

Assessable capital stock left shareholders open to critical financial risk in that they could never know about how much extra [capital](/capital) they would be called for or when. In the event that an individual didn't have the extra funds required they then, at that point, would automatically default on the stock and relinquish ownership, bringing about a loss of their initial investment.

It is easy to see the reason why stocks eventually transitioned to being non-assessable as it decreased the financial risk for investors. This thus helps companies also, as it makes buying stock more appealing.

## Special Considerations

It is generally viewed as that all stocks were assessable stocks during the nineteenth century and that companies moved from this practice to non-assessable stocks roughly in something like 10 years of World War I. As of now the assessable idea of stocks didn't make a difference to bankruptcy and insolvency cases yet rather at whatever point the [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) concluded they required extra capital. The board would basically make an assessment of the stock for a certain value and expect the [shareholder](/shareholder) to deliver the amount.

A company's stock type was constantly listed in its articles of incorporation so investors knew about the conceivable future liability. Assessable capital stock was famous with mining companies, particularly since mining is capital intensive and requires a fair setup of [financing](/financing). Besides, in the event that huge mineral reserves are not uncovered, a mining company could require extra capital to keep the company above water.

Be that as it may, the discount of buying assessable stock didn't offset the extra risk of giving extra capital in the event that the company's coffers ran dry. In the event that investors couldn't or reluctant to pay for extra assessments, their stock would return to the company-actually giving them zero return on the investment they had proactively paid.
