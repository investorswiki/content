# Virtual Machine
A virtual machine (VM) is a program which imitates a computer system. It has a virtual CPU, memory, and storage and shows up, from the outside, to be the same than a physical machine with a similar hardware.

## How Does a Virtual Machine Work?
A virtual machine has an operating system, documents, and applications. It works just like a physical computer; it can have sites, run programs, and exist on a network with different systems. Assuming saw on a screen, the virtual machine shows up as a window running inside that computers own operating system.
It likewise has a CPU, memory, and storage, yet these are reenacted, not physical. Along these lines, numerous virtual machines can exist together on one server. At the point when this occurs, the server utilizes a piece of software called a hypervisor to oversee them. The hypervisor maps the VM's virtual hardware to the physical parts on the server.
In this scenario, one physical server could have two, three, four, or even ten virtual machines running on it. In any case, the number is limited by the resources of the server - too numerous VMs will lead to diminished performance.

## Why Are Virtual Machines Used?
Virtual machines are sandboxes - bits of virtual space in which code can be run separately from the remainder of the system. This makes VMs ideal for testing new software or running code that may be malicious.

The virtual machine can run an alternate or more seasoned OS to empower a client to run software that won't deal with the computers operating system. For instance, somebody could utilize a VM to run a piece of Windows software on a Linux gadget. To accomplish this, they would run a virtual machine running a Windows operating system on their Linux system.

## Key Example: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The hubs on the Ethereum network all run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is utilized to execute smart contracts. Since this occurs in a separate sandbox, it gives significant security benefits to the Ethereum platform, making it resistant from the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service goes after that are a go-to strategy for some programmers.
