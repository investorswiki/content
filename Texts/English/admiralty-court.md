# Admiralty Court
## What Is an Admiralty Court?

An admiralty court is a council with jurisdiction over maritime law, including cases in regards to shipping, ocean, and sea laws. By and large, admiralty courts were a separate part of the court system. In modern times, these cases might be assigned inside the normal court system, as a rule at the federal or Superior Court level.

In the U.S., any court that is hearing a maritime case is an admiralty court as long as necessary.

## Understanding the Admiralty Court

An admiralty court hears shipping, ocean, and sea legal cases. The definition of such cases is broad, incorporating contracts, [torts](/misdeed law), wounds, and offenses connecting with maritime law and events that happen on the high seas.

The courts subsequently hear a scope of cases covering shipping, drifting, insurance matters connected with ships or their cargo, crashes at sea, civil issues including seamen, travelers, and cargo, salvage claims, claims for damages by ships, questioned ownership of ships, and, surprisingly, marine pollution cases.

Generally, modern admiralty courts hear civil actions, not criminal cases.

Admiralty courts have the power to issue a maritime lien against a ship, permitting the court or its appointees to hold onto the ship to settle claims against it.

Whether it very well may be held onto in different countries is administered by the admiralty courts of those countries and furthermore is subject to any settlements that might be in effect among the nations in question.
