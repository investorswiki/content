# Outperformance Option
## What Is an Outperformance Option?

An outperformance option is a derivative where the payoff value depends on the relative performance of one asset contrasted and another. It might likewise be alluded to as a "margrabe option".

## Grasping Outperformance Option

An outperformance option essentially sets the performance of one asset in opposition to another, with the difference being the gain for the investor. For instance, an investor might purchase an outperformance option, where they gain if the [S&P 500](/sp500) beats the FTSE 100 north of a six-month period. Assuming this occurs toward the finish of the six months, the option holder will gain. Nonetheless, assuming that the S&P has failed to meet expectations the [FTSE 100](/ftse) throughout this time span, the [option](/option) will lapse worthless.

Note that every asset might have unfathomably different [nominal prices](/nominalvalue). For instance, with stock A trading at $5 and stock B trading at $200, the nominal spread is certainly not a decent measure of performance. Stock A may gain $1 and stock B might gain $2 over the life of the option, in any case, the percentage gain for A would be 20% and for B would be 1%.

In this case, stock An extraordinarily outflanked stock B over the life of the option albeit the gains in dollar terms was half that of stock B. So outperformance options think about a similar value of every asset toward the beginning of the contract. The spread then checks out at the increase or abatement in relative value between the two assets.

For instance, two comparable companies in various countries might be impacted by their own nation's interest rates or currencies. Assuming the holder accepts the two companies have comparative possibilities yet one has extra risks due to their home market, the option can assist with moderating that risk.
