## What Is a Currency Exchange?

A currency exchange is a licensed business that permits customers to exchange one currency for another. Currency exchange of physical money (coins and paper bills) is normally finished over the counter at a teller station, which can be found in different places like airports, banks, lodgings, and resorts. Currency exchanges bring in money by charging a nominal fee and through the bid-ask spread in a currency.

Otherwise called a "department de change" or "casa de cambio," a currency exchange ought not be mistaken for the [foreign exchange (forex) market](/foreign-exchange-markets) where traders and financial institutions execute in currencies.

## How a Currency Exchange Works

Currency exchange businesses, both physical and online, permit you to exchange one country's currency for one more by executing buy and sell transactions. For instance, on the off chance that you have U.S. dollars and you need to exchange them for Australian dollars, you would bring your U.S. dollars (or bank card) to the currency exchange store and buy Australian dollars with them. The amount you would have the option to purchase would be dependent on the international [spot rate](/spot_rate), which is basically a daily changing value set by a network of banks that trade currencies.

The currency exchange store will change the rate by a certain percentage to guarantee that it creates a gain on the transaction. For instance, assume the spot rate for trading U.S. dollars into Australian dollars is listed as 1.2500 for the afternoon. This means that for each U.S. dollar spent, you can buy 1.25 Australian dollars whenever traded at the spot rate. Yet, the currency exchange store might change this rate to 1.20, meaning you can buy 1.20 Australian dollars for 1 U.S. dollar. With this speculative rate change, their fee would really be 5 pennies on the dollar.

Since the [transaction](/transaction) isn't led at the spot rate, and depends on the profit that the exchange needs to make, consumers might observe that it is more affordable to cause [ATM](/atm) or [credit card](/creditcard) fees at the foreign destination, instead of purpose exchange services ahead of time. Travelers are encouraged to estimate how much money they will spend on a trip and compare the amounts saved through normal transactions.

## Bid-Ask Spreads in the Retail Forex Market

Currency exchanges earn their money by charging customers a fee for their services, yet in addition by exploiting the bid-ask spread in the currency. The [bid price](/bidprice) is the thing the dealer will pay for a currency, while the [ask price](/ask) is the rate at which a dealer will sell a similar currency.

For instance, Ellen is an American traveler visiting Europe. The cost of purchasing euros at the airport might be quoted as follows:

>
> [EUR](/euro) 1 = USD 1.30/1.40
>

The higher price (USD 1.40) is the cost to buy every euro. Ellen needs to buy EUR 5,000, so she would need to pay the dealer USD 7,000.

Assume additionally that the next traveler in line has just returned from her European vacation and needs to sell the euros that she has left finished. Katelyn has EUR 5,000 to sell. She can sell the euros at the bid price of USD 1.30 (the lower price) and would receive USD 6,500 in exchange for her euros.

In light of the bid-ask spread, the kiosk dealer can create a gain of USD 500 from this transaction (the difference between USD 7,000 and USD 6,500).

When confronted with a standard bid and ask price for a currency, the higher price is what you would pay to buy the currency and the lower price is what you would receive if you somehow managed to sell the currency.
