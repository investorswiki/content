## What Is a Trading Curb?

A trading curb, likewise called a "[circuit breaker](/circuitbreaker)," is the transitory halting of trading with the goal that excess [volatility](/volatility) can be gotten control over and order reestablished.

At the point when such a halt is set off, markets are supposed to be "[curbs in](/curbs-in)".

## Figuring out Trading Curbs

Represented by [Securities and Exchange Commission's](/sec) (SEC) Rule 80B, a trading curb is a brief restriction on trading in a specific security or market, intended to reduce excess volatility. Trading curbs were first carried out after the stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987 (known as "[Black Monday](/blackmonday)"), as program trading was believed to be the primary reason for the plunge. The rule was amended in 2013 in response to the purported [Flash Crash](/flash-crash) of May 6, 2010.

The purpose of trading curbs is to permit the market to slow down and rest when it is shaken by extreme volatility. Brief halts to trading give market participants time to think about how they need to answer large and startling developments of market indexes or individual securities when the curbs are lifted. The circuit breakers apply to all [equities](/value), [options](/choice), and [futures](/futurescontract) on U.S. exchanges.

> A few analysts accept that trading curbs are disruptive and keep the market falsely unpredictable in light of the fact that they make orders build at the limit level and decline liquidity. Pundits of circuit breakers contend that assuming that the market were permitted to move uninhibitedly, with practically no halts, they would subside into a more steady equilibrium.

## Curbs In Levels

The [S&P 500 Index](/sp500) fills in as the reference index for daily estimations of three breakpoints (Levels 1, 2, and 3) that would cause trading halts.

- **Level 1** is a 7% decline from the previous day's close of the S&P 500 Index, which will bring about a 15-minute trading halt; in any case, on the off chance that the 7% decline happens in something like 35 minutes of market close, no halt will be forced.
- **Level 2** is a 13% decline that will likewise cause a 15-minute halt; comparatively, there would be no stop in trading assuming that the 13% decline happens in the span of 35 minutes of market close.
- **Level 3** is a 20% drop that will bring about the closing of the stock market until the end of the day.

Under current rules, a trading halt on an individual security is put into effect in the event that there is a 10% change in the value of a security that is a member of the S&P 500 Index, [Russell 1000 Index](/russell_1000index), or QQQ ETF ([exchange-traded fund](/etf)) inside a five-minute time period, 30% change in the value of a security whose price is equivalent or greater than $1 per share, and half change in the value of a security whose price is under $1 per share.

For individual securities, trading curbs can be set off assuming that the price is expanding or decreasing. On the other hand, circuit breakers that connect with broad market indices are just set off in view of downward price developments.

## History of Trading Curbs

On Oct. 19, 1987, known as Black Monday, numerous securities markets across the world crashed, making a sort of cascading type of influence. In the U.S., the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/djia) — an index that fills in as an overall indicator of the state of the stock market and economy in general — crashed by 508 (which was 22.61%).

In the wake of this crash, then-President Ronald Reagan collected a committee of specialists. Reagan requested that them concoct rules and limits to forestall a total market crash once more. The committee, called the Brady Commission, discovered that the reason for the crash was a lack of communication in view of a fast market, leading to confusion among traders and the fast drop of the market.

To tackle this problem they initiated a gadget called a circuit breaker, or a curb, which would halt trading when the market hit a certain volume of loss. This impermanent stop of trading was intended to give the traders space to speak with one another. The original goal of the circuit breaker was not to forestall emotional swings in the market yet to give time for this communication.

Since that time, other trading curbs have been established and have come all through use, including a program trading curbs that went on for five days in November 2007.
