## History of the TANSTAAFL Concept

The concept of TANSTAAFL is remembered to have originated in nineteenth century American cantinas where customers were given free snacks with the purchase of beverages. From the essential structure of the offer, it is obvious that there is an implicit cost associated with the free lunch: the purchase of a beverage.

In any case, there are extra concealed [costs](/working cost) coming about because of the consumption of the free lunch. Since the snacks were high in salt, customers were tempted to purchase more beverages. So the cantinas deliberately offered free snacks with the expectation that they would produce sufficient revenue in extra beverages to offset the cost of the lunch. The proposal of a free decent or service with the purchase of another great or service is an oxymoronic strategy numerous organizations actually use to tempt customers.

TANSTAAFL has been referred to commonly generally in a wide range of settings. For instance, in 1933, former New York City chairman Fiorello H. La Guardia utilized the Italian phrase "**\u00e8 finita la cuccagna!"** (translating to "not any more free lunch") in that frame of mind against crime and corruption.

As an investor moves higher on the risk range, the phrase TANSTAAFL turns out to be even more pertinent as investors give capital any desires for achieving larger gains than what less-riskier [securities](/security) yield; nonetheless, this decision accepts the cost that growth possibilities may not be accomplished and the investment could be lost.
