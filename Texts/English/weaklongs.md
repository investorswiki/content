## What Are Weak Longs?

Weak longs are investors who hold a [long](/long) position and are quick to exit that position at the earliest hint of weakness. This type of investor is ordinarily attempting to capture the upside capability of a security however without critical loss. These investors will quickly [close](/closeposition) their positions when a trade doesn't move in support of themselves.

## Understanding Weak Longs

Weak longs are much of the time short-term traders instead of long-term [investors](/investor) since they are reluctant to hold their positions through market variances. In the event that a trade doesn't move in support of themselves, they will quickly close their positions and search somewhere else for opportunities. Most weak longs are momentum traders who are more keen on a quick profit than investing in [undervalued](/undervalued) companies until they arrive at a fair value.

When weak longs close their position, it might introduce an opportunity for different investors to [buy into the dip](/buy-the-dips). The selling pressure that weak longs make while closing their positions can lead to consolidation in a stock after a huge uptrend. This makes sense of why stocks will generally finish out subsequent to following a [earnings](/earnings) announcement on the grounds that these traders lock in their profits and continue on toward other investment opportunities.

The benefit of a weak long is that the investor can get profits quickly instead of capitulating to the [disposition](/disposition) effect, holding onto a losing stock for a really long time. In any case, weak longs will generally create significant stir in their portfolio, making it harder to stay profitable like using a long-term investing strategy.

## Illustration of Weak Longs

At the point when a company reports good earnings for the quarter, short-term traders might buy the stock at the open to capitalize on the run-up while long-term investors might add the stock to their existing positions. Weak longs will hold the stock until it starts to [consolidate](/consolidation) following an earnings run-up, selling the stock and moving on to different opportunities. Long-term investors will keep holding the stock.

Long-term investors might exploit the consolidation to add to their position and lower their cost basis. Long-term investors might look out for the sidelines following a positive earnings announcement and buy the stock after it starts to move lower and consolidate. This permits them to buy the stock at a lower price and at last increase their long-term profit potential.
