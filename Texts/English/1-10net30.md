# 1%/10 Net 30
## What Is 1%/10 Net 30?

The 1%/10 net 30 calculation is an approach to giving [cash discounts](/cash-discount) on purchases. That's what it means assuming the bill is paid in the span of 10 days, there is a 1% discount. In any case, the total amount is due in 30 days or less.

## Understanding 1%/10 Net 30

The 1%/10 net 30 calculation addresses the credit terms and payment requirements illustrated by a seller. The vendor might offer incentives to pay right on time to speed up the inflow of cash. This is especially important for cash-tied organizations or companies with no revolving [lines of credit](/lineofcredit). Companies with higher [profit margins](/profitmargin) are bound to offer cash discounts.

Albeit the numbers are consistently compatible across vendors, the standard structure for offering a payment discount is something very similar. The principal number will continuously be the percentage discount. This figure will demonstrate the total percentage discount on the invoice prior to transportation or taxes that might be discounted upon early payment.

## Special Considerations

Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual [short-term loans](/shorttermdebt). This is since, in such a case that the discount isn't taken, the buyer must pay the higher price rather than paying a scaled down cost. In effect, the difference between these two prices mirrors the discount lost, which can be reported as a percentage. This percentage is called the cost of credit.

At the point when the credit terms are 1%/10 net 30, the net outcome becomes, basically, an interest charge of 18.2% upon the inability to take the discount.

The accounting entry for a cash discount taken might be acted in two ways. The gross method of purchase discounts accepts the discount won't be taken and will just info the discount upon genuine receipt of payment inside the discount period.

In this manner, the whole amount of receivable will be [debited](/charge). At the point when payment is received, the receivable will be credited in the amount of the payment and the difference will be a credit to discounts taken. The alternative method is called the net method. For a discount of 1%/10 net 30, it is assumed the 1% discount will be taken. This outcomes in a receivable being charged for the vast majority of the total cost.

## Illustration of 1%/10 Net 30

> In the event that the invoice isn't paid inside the discount period, no price reduction happens, and the invoice must be paid inside the stipulated number of days before late fees might be assessed.
>

The subsequent number is dependably the number of days of the [discount period](/discounting). In the model over, the discount period is 10 days. At last, the third number generally mirrors the invoice due date.
