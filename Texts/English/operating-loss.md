# Operating Loss (OL)
## What Is an Operating Loss (OL)?

An operating loss happens when a company's [operating expenses](/operating_expense) surpass [gross profits](/grossprofit) (or revenues on account of a service-situated company). A company's operating profit is its profit before interest and taxes. Interest and taxes are not viewed as operating expenses in the manner that cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses are. Frequently companies produce sufficient revenue to cover the operating expenses and create an operating gain.

An operating loss doesn't think about the effects of interest income, [interest expense](/interestexpense), extraordinary gains or losses, or income or losses from equity investments or taxes. These things are "underneath the line," meaning they are added or deducted after the operating loss (or income, if positive) to show up at net income.

On the off chance that there is an operating loss, there is normally a net income loss except if an extraordinary gain (e.g., sale of an asset) was recorded during the accounting period.

## Grasping Operating Losses

An operating loss shows that a company's core operations are not profitable and that changes should be made to increase revenues, decline costs, or both. The immediate solution is normally to cut back on expenses, as this is inside the control of company management. Cutbacks, office or plant closings, or reductions in marketing spending are ways of lessening expenses. An operating loss is expected for new businesses that for the most part bring about high expenses (with practically no revenues) as they endeavor to rapidly develop.

In most different circumstances, whenever maintained, an operating loss is an indication of decaying fundamentals of a company's products or services. Nonetheless, that is not really the case assuming a company is spending more money in the short-term to hire extra employees, conduct a new sales and marketing campaign, or [lease](/lease) extra office space in anticipation of expanded future business. In such a scenario, a company might be hit with a couple or several fourth of operating losses until the bump-up of the expenditures declines and the benefits of the additional spending manifest in the [top line](/topline).

## Real World Example of Operating Loss

For a company that fabricates products, gross profit is sales less the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS). In 2009, the year that the [Great Recession](/great-recession) grabbed hold, Huntsman Corporation recorded an operating loss of more than $71 million. That year gross profit was $1,068 million, while operating expenses made out of selling, general, and administration (SG&A), research and development (R&D), restructuring, impairment, and plant closing costs added up to $1,139 million, leaving the compound maker with an operating loss. The last expense detail was $152 million in charges. Such expenses, much of the time, are thought of as non-repeating, and that means that a normalized operating income/loss number would prohibit the charge. Rather than the operating loss, an "changed" result would be an operating profit of $81 million.
