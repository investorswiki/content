However, the two funds went into liquidation a couple of months after the fact. At the point when the original investor presented a proof of debt, seeking to collect their money, it was dismissed by the liquidators of the Ardon Maroon Asia master fund, on the basis that Asia Dragon had never formally presented a separate redemption request notice to it.

A claim resulted, recorded in the Cayman Islands, where the funds were based. In mid-2018, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled for the master fund. Albeit back-to-back redemptions are common industry rehearses, the court noticed that the constitutional reports of Ardon Maroon Asia required a written notice of redemption from its feeder funds.

So Asia Dragon had been delinquent in not separately telling its master fund even however similar individuals filled in as directors of two funds, and both named a similar investment manager, administrator, and transfer agent.
