## What Is a Tax Refund?

A tax refund is a reimbursement to a taxpayer for any excess amount paid to the federal government or a state government. While taxpayers tend to view at a refund as a bonus or a stroke of karma, it often represents what is essentially an interest-free loan that the taxpayer made to the government. It's generally expected possible to try not to overpay your taxes so you can keep more money in your pocket each paycheck — and stay away from a refund when you file your [tax return](/taxreturn).

## Understanding Tax Refunds

It very well may be exciting to get a large tax refund. In any case, taxpayers are generally better off not overpaying their taxes in the first place because that money could be put to better use. For example, you could change your withholding (or estimated quarterly taxes, assuming you're self-employed) and invest that "extra" money in your individual retirement account (IRA), 401(k), or even an interest-yielding savings account. Like that, the money is working for you instead of for the federal government.

> To abstain from overpaying, you must finish up your W-4 correctly and update it in the event that you experience a critical life change, like marriage, divorce, adoption, a new freelance job or gig, or the introduction of a child.

Here are some reasons why a taxpayer could get a refund:

- The taxpayer has made an error in finishing up [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) Form W-4, used to estimate the correct amount of withholding from the employee's paycheck.
- The taxpayer intentionally finishes up their W-4 to have a higher withholding and larger tax refund at tax time.
- The taxpayer has forgotten to update their W-4 to reflect a change of circumstances, for example, the introduction of a child and consequently an extra Child Tax Credit.

- A freelancer or self-employed person who files quarterly [estimated taxes](/estimated-tax) may overpay to stay away from a surprise tax bill or underpayment penalties at tax time.
- The taxpayer is eligible for [refundable tax credits](/refundablecredit), which can reduce the amount of taxes owed below $0, even on the off chance that no tax was otherwise owed. On the off chance that the credit is larger than your tax bill, you will receive a refund for the difference.

## Refundable Tax Credits

Most tax credits are [nonrefundable](/nonrefundabletaxcredit), meaning that the tax credit can reduce a taxpayer's liability to $0. Any remaining amount from a nonrefundable tax credit is consequently forfeited by the taxpayer. Hence, this type of tax credit is sometimes called a "wastable" tax credit.

Conversely, a refundable tax credit cover out, meaning that a taxpayer is entitled to the entire amount of the credit — regardless of their income or tax liability. On the off chance that the tax credit reduces the tax liability to below $0, the taxpayer gets a refund. Refundable tax credits include:

### Child Tax Credit (CTC)

For tax year 2020, the [Child Tax Credit (CTC)](/childtaxcredit) was a maximum of $2,000, with up to $1,400 refundable. For tax year 2021, the CTC increases to $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6 as part of the American Rescue Plan. The credit is now fully refundable rather than partially refundable, and there is no income limit for the credit.

### Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

The [Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)](/earnedincomecredit) gives low-and moderate-income workers and families a tax break. The credit ranges from $1,502 to $6,728 for 2021 and from $560 to $6,935 for 2022. The amount of credit that a taxpayer receives depends on their income, filing status, and the number of children they have.

### American opportunity tax credit (AOTC)

The [American opportunity tax credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) is a partially refundable tax credit that is available to taxpayers to offset [qualified higher education expenses (QHEEs)](/qhee). In the event that a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to $0 before utilizing the entire portion of the $2,500 tax deduction, then the remainder might be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000.

### Premium tax credit (PTC)

Low-and moderate-income households might meet all requirements for the premium tax credit (PTC), which lowers the month to month premiums for health plans offered through the federal and state health benefit exchanges. Taxpayers can use all, some, or none of their PTC in advance (i.e., front and center). In the event that taxpayers use less PTC than they fit the bill for, they will get the difference as a refundable credit at tax time.

## How a Tax Refund Works

Tax refunds for the most part are issued as either paper checks that go through the mail or direct deposits to the taxpayer's bank account. Alternatively, taxpayers can use the refund to buy U.S. [Series I Savings Bonds](/seriesibond). The [fastest way to get a refund](/tax-refund) is to e-file your tax return and choose direct deposit.

Most refunds are issued within a few weeks of when the taxpayer files their tax return. However, there might be some instances where a refund takes longer.

For example, taxpayers who claim the EITC will not receive their refunds before March (the law requires the IRS to hold on to these refunds until March due to years of fraudulent filings for the credit).

Refunds are always pleasant, however it would be better to abstain from overpaying in the first place by correctly finishing up your W-4 or precisely computing your estimated taxes. The closer you get your refund to zero, the more money you will have all through the prior year.

Of course, not everyone agrees. Some people consider tax refunds an alternative savings plan and anticipate the lump-sum repayment.
