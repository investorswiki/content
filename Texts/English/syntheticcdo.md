# Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)
## What Is a Synthetic CDO?

A synthetic CDO is a financial product that invests in non-cash assets like swaps, options, and insurance contracts to get exposure to a portfolio of fixed-income assets.

It is one sort of [collateralized debt obligation](/cdo) (CDO). A CDO is a financial product structured by banks that pool and package cash-generating assets into financial securities. These are then sold to investors.

For instance, a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) is a CDO. Mortgages are the collateral. Investors hope to bring in money on their investment from the repayment of mortgage loans.

Synthetic CDOs are regularly partitioned into [tranches](/tranches), or segments, in view of the level of credit risk an investor wishes to accept. Initial investments in the CDO happen in the lower tranches. Senior tranches may not include an initial investment.

## Grasping Synthetic CDOs

Synthetic CDOs are a modern advance in structured finance that can offer very high yields to investors. They are dissimilar to other CDOs, which commonly invest in traditional debt products like bonds, mortgages, and loans.

All things being equal, synthetic CDOs produce income from non-cash derivatives, for example, a [credit default swap](/creditdefaultswap) (CDS), options, and different contracts.

While a traditional CDO produces income for the seller from cash assets like loans, credit cards, and mortgages, the value of a synthetic CDO comes from, for instance, insurance premiums of credit default swaps paid for by investors.

The seller takes a long position in the synthetic CDO, expecting the underlying assets will perform. The investor, then again, takes a short position, expecting the underlying assets will default.

Investors can be on the hook for significantly more than their initial investments on the off chance that several credit events happen inside the reference portfolio. In a synthetic CDO, all tranches receive periodic payments in light of cash flows from the credit default swaps.

Typically, synthetic CDO payoffs are just impacted by credit events associated with CDSs. On the off chance that a credit event happens in the fixed income portfolio, the synthetic CDO and its investors become responsible for the losses, starting from the lowest-rated tranches and on up.

## Synthetic CDOs and Tranches

Tranches are otherwise called cuts of credit risk between risk levels. The three tranches basically utilized in CDOs are known as senior, mezzanine, and equity. The senior tranche incorporates securities with high credit ratings, will in general be low risk, and in this way has lower returns.

On the other hand, an equity-level tranche conveys a higher degree of risk and holds derivatives with lower credit ratings, so it offers higher returns. Albeit the equity-level tranche might offer higher returns, the primary tranche would assimilate any likely losses.

Tranches make synthetic CDOs appealing to investors since they can gain exposure that matches their risk hunger. For instance, expect an investor wishes to invest in a high-rated synthetic CDO that included U.S. Treasury bonds and [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) that are rated AAA (the highest credit rating offered by Standard and Poor's).

A bank can make the synthetic CDO that offers to pay the U.S. Treasury security's yield plus the corporate bonds' yields. This would be a single tranche synthetic CDO that just incorporates the senior-level tranche.

## Synthetic CDOs: Then and Now

Synthetic CDOs were first made in the late 1990s as a way for large holders of commercial loans to safeguard their balance sheets without selling the loans and possibly hurting client connections.

They turned out to be progressively well known in light of the fact that they would in general have shorter life ranges than cash flow CDOs, and there was no extended ramp-up period for earnings investment. Synthetic CDOs were likewise highly customizable, to the degree wanted by the underwriter and investors.

They were highly reprimanded for their part in the subprime mortgage crisis, which prompted the [Great Recession](/great-recession). Investors initially just approached subprime mortgage bonds for however many mortgages as existed. In any case, with the creation of synthetic CDOs and credit default swaps, exposure to these assets increased.

Investors didn't understand that the underlying assets carried high risk. As homeowners defaulted on their mortgages, ratings agencies downsized CDOs, leading investment firms to advise investors that they wouldn't have the option to pay their money back.

Regardless of their checkered past, synthetic CDOs might be encountering a resurgence. Investors searching for high yields are going to these investments by and by, and large banks and investments firms are answering the demand by hiring credit traders who have some expertise in this area.
