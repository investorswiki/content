# Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)
## What Are REITs and How Do They Work?
Real estate investment trusts (REITs for short) are companies that invest in real estate and additionally real estate financing and disseminate somewhere around 90% of their profits to shareholders as dividends. Many are publicly traded on major exchanges and can be bought and sold rapidly and effectively just like traditional stocks.
A few REITs bring in money by renting out real estate (e.g., homes, offices, cell towers, retail spaces, warehouses, and so on) that they own, while others do as such by giving mortgages to property buyers in exchange for interest payments. Certain REITs use the two types of income streams.
In light of their high and steady [dividends](/dividend), REITs are a famous investment vehicle for investors who need the passive income that accompanies claiming real estate yet don't have the opportunity or money to buy, keep up with, and rent out their very own property. They are likewise well known during periods of higher-than-expected [inflation](/inflation), as rent and real estate will generally become more expensive alongside consumer goods, sometimes bringing about more money for REIT shareholders when traditional stocks might waver.

Since the overwhelming majority of a REIT's profits are distributed as dividends, little cash ordinarily stays for investing in growth, so share price will in general can possibly go up decisively (i.e., they aren't for the most part as unpredictable as traditional stocks). Therefore, REITs are significantly more well known with fixed income investors (those searching for ordinary dividend payments) than growth investors (those hoping to see their principal investment fill substantially in value over the long run).
## What Makes a Company a REIT?

To qualify as a REIT, a company must pay out something like 90% of its taxable income as dividends. REITs must likewise . . .
- "be managed by a board of directors or trustees,
- determine no less than 75 percent of its gross income from real estate related sources, remembering rents from real property and interest for mortgages financing real property,
- invest something like 75 percent of its total assets in real estate assets and cash,
