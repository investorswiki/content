# True Lease
## What Is a True Lease?

A true lease is a type of long term lease where the [lessor](/lessor) gives the [lessee](/lessee) exclusive rights to involve and have property or equipment for a month to month fee over a predefined period. Ownership rights of the asset don't give to the lessee.

## How True Leases Work

A true lease is otherwise called a tax lease or a tax-situated lease. It is alluded to as true since this type of contract passes the accounting requirements for the lessor to claim all associated [tax benefits](/tax-benefit), including depreciation deductions, on the leased property or equipment. On the other hand, the lessee claims lease payments as a capital expense.

At the finish of the lease term, and when no extension has been marked, the lessee is responsible for emptying the property in the condition in which it was leased, or in close nearness to. On account of leased equipment, the lessee is responsible for returning any equipment utilized on favorable terms. The lessee might have the option to purchase the equipment outright in certain circumstances.

A true lease contrasts from a finance lease. Basically, a finance lease is one where the lessor purchases the asset for a lessee and rents it to them over a defined period. The lessee makes payments that cover the original cost of the asset during the initial, or primary, period of the lease. In certain occurrences, there will be a bigger payment made toward the finish of the contract, otherwise called a [balloon payment](/balloon-payment). The lessee gets exclusive utilization of the asset gave they stick to the terms framed in the agreement.

## Model: Operating Leases

Not at all like a finance lease, the risks and rewards of ownership to a great extent don't transfer over to the lessee under what is known as a [operating lease](/operatinglease). The duration of this type of lease is regularly not exactly that of the [economic value](/economic-value) of the leased asset. Toward the finish of the lease, the lessor would hope to have the option to separate extra economic value from the asset; this would be alluded to as the residual value.

Toward the beginning of any lease, the lessor will consider the [residual value](/residual-value) forecast for the asset toward the finish of the lease with an end goal to set expectations for any extra value the asset could bring. Most operating leases include assets that will have a value toward the finish of the lease, including vehicles or heavy equipment and machinery of some kind or another.
