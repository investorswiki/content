# Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
## What Is a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?

A systematic investment plan (SIP) is a plan where investors make normal, equivalent payments into a mutual fund, [trading account](/tradingaccount), or retirement account, for example, a 401(k). SIPs allow investors to save consistently with a smaller amount of money while benefiting from the long-term advantages of [dollar-cost averaging](/dollarcostaveraging) (DCA). By utilizing a DCA strategy, an investor buys an investment utilizing periodic equivalent transfers of funds to slowly build wealth or a portfolio over the long run.

## How SIPs Work

Mutual funds and other investment companies offer investors an assortment of investment options including systematic investment plans. SIPs allow investors an opportunity to invest small sums of money over a longer period of time instead of making large [lump sums](/lump-sum-payment) at the same time. Most SIPs require payments into the plans on a reliable basis — whether that is week by week, month to month, or quarterly.

The principle of systematic investing is simple. It deals with customary and periodic purchases of shares or units of securities of a fund or other investment. Dollar-cost averaging includes buying a similar fixed-dollar amount of a [security](/security) no matter what its price at each periodic interval. Thus, shares are bought at different prices and in changing amounts — however a few plans might let you assign a fixed number of shares to buy. Since the amount invested is generally fixed and doesn't rely upon unit or share prices, an investor winds up buying less [shares](/shares) when unit prices rise and more shares when prices drop.

SIPs will generally be passive investments on the grounds that once you put money in, you keep on investing in it paying little mind to how it performs. That is the reason it's important to keep an eye on how much [wealth](/wealth) you collect in your SIP. Whenever you've hit a certain amount or arrive at a point close to your retirement, you might need to reexamine your investment plans. Moving to a strategy or investment that is actively managed may allow you to develop your money even more. Be that as it may, it's dependably smart to address a [financial advisor](/financial-advisor) or expert to determine the best situation for you.

## Special Considerations

DCA advocates contend that with this approach, the average cost per share of the security diminishes over the long haul. Of course, the strategy can misfire on the off chance that you have a stock whose price rises consistently and emphatically. That means investing after some time costs you more than if you bought at the same time at the outset. Overall, DCA generally diminishes the cost of an investment. The [risk](/risk) of investing a large amount of money into security likewise reduces.

Since most DCA strategies are laid out on an automatic purchasing schedule, systematic investment plans eliminate the investor's true capacity for going with poor choices in view of emotional responses to market vacillations. For instance, when stock prices take off and news sources report new market records being set, investors ordinarily buy more risky assets.

Interestingly, when stock prices drop decisively for an extended period, numerous investors hurry to empty their shares. Buying high and selling low is in direct difference with dollar-cost averaging and other sound investment rehearses, especially for long-term investors.

## SIPs and DRIPs

Notwithstanding SIPs, numerous investors utilize the earnings their [holdings](/holdings) create to purchase business as usual security, through a [dividend reinvestment plan](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIP). Reinvesting dividends means stockholders might purchase shares or parts of shares in publicly traded companies they currently own. As opposed to sending the investor a quarterly check for dividends, the company, transfer agent, or brokerage firm purposes the money to purchase extra stock in the investor's name. Dividend reinvestment plans are likewise automatic — the investor assigns the treatment of dividends when they lay out an account or first buy the stock — and they let shareholders invest variable amounts in a company over a long-term period.

Company-operated DRIPs are sans commission. That is on the grounds that there could be no broker expected to work with the trade. A few DRIPs offer discretionary cash purchases of extra shares directly from the company at a 1% to 10% discount without any fees. Since DRIPs are flexible, investors might invest small or large amounts of money, contingent upon their financial situation.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Systematic Investment Plans

It likewise allows you to utilize a small amount so you don't feel the effects of a big lump sum being [withdrawn](/withdrawal) at the same time.

Since you're utilizing DCA, there's tiny inclination included.
