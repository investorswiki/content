# Demand Draft
## What Is a Demand Draft?

A demand draft is a method utilized by an individual to make a [transfer payment](/transferpayment) starting with one bank account then onto the next. Demand drafts vary from customary normal[ checks](/check) in that they don't expect signatures to be changed. In 2005, due to the rising fraudulent utilization of demand drafts, the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) proposed new regulations expanding a casualty's right to claim a refund and holding banks more accountable for cashing fraudulent checks.

## Understanding Demand Drafts

At the point when a bank prepares a demand draft, the amount of the draft is assessed the customer mentioning the draft and is transferred to an account at another bank. The cabinet is the person mentioning the demand draft; the bank paying the money is the [drawee](/drawee); the party getting the money is the [payee](/payee). Demand drafts were initially intended to benefit real phone salespeople who expected to pull out funds from customer checking accounts utilizing their bank account numbers and bank routing numbers.

For instance, on the off chance that a small business owner purchases products from one more company on credit, the small business owner requests that his bank send a demand draft to the company for payment of the products, making him the cabinet. The bank issues the draft, making it the drawee. After the draft develops, the owner of the other company brings the demand draft to his bank and gathers his payment, making him the payee.

### Demand Drafts Versus Checks

A demand draft is issued by a bank while a check is issued by an individual. Likewise, a demand draft is drawn by an employee of a bank while a check is drawn by a customer of a bank. Payment of a demand draft may not be stopped by the cabinet as it might with a check.

> Since a demand draft is a prepaid instrument, payment can't be stopped, while payment of a check might be denied for inadequate funds.

Albeit a check can be hand-conveyed, this isn't the case with a demand draft. The draft might be drawn whether or not an individual holds an account at the bank while a check might be written exclusively by an account holder.
