## What Is the Nixon Shock?

Nixon Shock is a phrase used to portray the aftereffect of a set of economic policies promoted by former President Richard Nixon in 1971.

Most eminently, the policies eventually prompted the collapse of the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) system of [fixed exchange rates](/fixedexchangerate) that came full circle after World War II.

## Understanding the Nixon Shock

The Nixon Shock followed President Nixon's broadcast New Economic Policy address to the nation. The core of the discourse was that the U.S. would direct its concentration toward domestic issues in the post-Vietnam War time. Nixon framed three fundamental objectives for the plan:

1. Making better jobs
1. Stemming the rise in the cost of living
1. Protecting the U.S. dollar from international money examiners.

Nixon refered to tax cuts and a 90-day hold on prices and wages as the best options for supporting the job market and packing down the [cost of living](/cost-of-living). Concerning speculative behavior toward the U.S. dollar (USD), Nixon upheld suspending the dollar's convertibility into gold. Furthermore, Nixon proposed an extra 10% tax on all [imports](/import) that were subject to duties. Like the strategy of suspending dollar convertibility, the levy planned to support the United States' principal trading partners to raise the value of their currencies.

The Bretton Woods Agreement rotated around the outside values of foreign currencies. Fixed versus the U.S. dollar, the value of foreign currencies was communicated in gold at a price determined by Congress. Nonetheless, a dollar surplus endangered the system during the 1960s. At that point, the U.S. needed more gold to cover the volume of dollars circulating all through the world. That prompted a [overvaluation](/overvalued) of the dollar.

The government endeavored to support the dollar and Bretton Woods, with the Kennedy and Johnson organizations attempting to deflect foreign investment, limit foreign lending, and change international monetary policy. Notwithstanding, their efforts were largely fruitless.

Nervousness eventually crawled into the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), with traders abroad unfortunate of an eventual dollar [devaluation](/devaluation). Subsequently, they started selling USD in greater sums and all the more habitually. After several runs on the dollar, Nixon looked for another economic course for the country.

Nixon's discourse was not received also internationally as it was in the United States. Numerous in the international community deciphered Nixon's plan as a unilateral act. In response, the [Group of Ten](/groupoften) (G-10) industrialized majority rules systems settled on new exchange rates that fixated on a devalued dollar in what became known as the [Smithsonian Agreement](/smithsonian-agreement). That plan came full circle in December 1971, however it proved fruitless.

Beginning in February 1973, speculative market pressure made the USD devalue and prompted a progression of [exchange parities](/parityprice). In the midst of still-weighty pressure on the dollar in March of that year, the G-10 carried out a strategy that called for six European individuals to tie their currencies together and jointly [float](/float) them against the dollar.

That decision basically brought a finish to the fixed exchange rate system laid out by Bretton Woods.

Central banks presently have a greater degree of control over their own money, making it simple to "make due" factors, for example, interest rates, overall money supply, and velocity.

Then again, Nixon's move likewise made uncertainties and prompted a monstrous market in view of [hedging](/fence) the risks made by currency vulnerability. The financial crisis of 2007-2008, in particular, proved that central bank control is no guaranteed defense against extreme recessions.
