## Historical Problems With FmHA

By the 1990s, a few individuals from Congress were turning out to be progressively worried about the large number of [defaults](/default2) on FmHA loans and the substantial losses the agency was gathering because of weak lending practices. In 1992, Congress directed the U.S. [Government Accountability Office (GAO)](/government-accountability-office-gao) to conduct a study, which revealed various issues with the FmHA.

Most eminently, the report found that almost $14 billion (70%) of the FmHA direct loan portfolio was at risk of default in light of the fact that the loans were held by delinquent borrowers or by people whose obligations were rescheduled in the wake of repayment challenges. In that year, FmHA estimated likely losses of $1.2 billion, or around 28% of its guaranteed loan program.

The GAO additionally found that many field lending authorities failed to follow the loan-production and [loan-servicing](/loan_servicing) standards that the FmHA laid out to shield federal financial interests.

Besides, the GAO found that by Sept. 30, 1991, the FmHA acquired an estimated 3,100 farms from borrowers who had not reimbursed their loans. Overall, the GAO reasoned that FmHA management weaknesses contributed to the well established loan management issues, including inferior data systems and weak financial controls.
