# Closed Account
## What Is a Closed Account?

A closed account is any account that has been deactivated or generally terminated, either by the customer, custodian or counterparty. At this stage, no further [credits](/credit) and debits can be added.

In accounting, a closed account — or [closing entry](/closing-entry) — alludes to the annual course of moving data from transitory accounts on the income statement to permanent accounts on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) to begin the new fiscal year (FY) with a balance of zero.

## Grasping a Closed Account

In finance, when we think about closed accounts, retail or institutional banks, consumer financing companies, and brokerage firms quickly spring to mind. The term can mean the stopping of any arrangement with a [financial institution](/financialinstitution) (FI) to care for a customer's money, whether that be in a checking, savings, derivative trading, credit card, car loan or brokerage account.

In some cases it very well may be the client that selects to close an account. On the other hand, the custodian — the financial institution — that holds customers' [securities](/security) for safekeeping, might be the one to deactivate it.

Companies can find proactive ways to close customers' accounts assuming they consider such action to be suitable. A few accounts are closed right away. Others are subject to a defer in processing or are contingent on the [settlement](/settlement_period) of trades or on [payment](/payment) [obligations](/commitment).

There are generally no adverse ramifications for a customer account. The clearest exception is the point at which a credit card account is closed. At the point when this happens it could make the customer experience a short-term drop in their [credit score](/credit_score).

Year-end planning of a company's books includes closing out income statement details from transitory accounts and posting them to a permanent account housed on the balance sheet. [Revenues](/revenue), expenses, gains, and losses are impermanent accounts that are "purged" into [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) — the permanent account — toward the end of the fiscal year. All in all, the income statement things are charged and the retained earnings account is credited.

The goal here is to reset the impermanent [account balances](/accountbalance) to zero on the [general ledger](/generalledger), the record-staying with system for a's financial data. All revenue and expense accounts must end with a $0.00 balance since they are reported in defined periods and are not carried over into what's to come. For instance, $100 in revenue this year doesn't count as $100 of revenue for next year, even on the off chance that the company retained the funds for use in the next 12 months.

Permanent accounts, then again, track activities that extend past the current accounting period. On the balance sheet, $75.00 of cash held today is as yet valued at $75.00 next year.
