# Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
## What Is Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)?

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR), otherwise called "tertiary recovery," is a cycle for removing oil that has not as of now been recovered through the [primary](/primary-recovery) or secondary oil recovery techniques.

Albeit the primary and secondary recovery techniques depend on the pressure differential between the surface and the underground well, enhanced oil recovery capabilities by changing the compound creation of the oil itself to make it more straightforward to remove.

## How Enhanced Oil Recovery Works

Enhanced oil recovery techniques are complex and costly and in this way are employed just when the primary and secondary recovery techniques have exhausted their handiness. For sure, contingent upon factors, for example, the cost of oil, it may not be affordable to utilize EOR by any means. In those cases, oil and gas may be left in the repository since removing the excess amounts is essentially not productive.

## Three Main Types of EOR Techniques

In the principal type of technique, gases are strongly infused into the well such that the two powers the oil to the surface and reduces its thickness. The less gooey the oil, the simpler it flows and the more inexpensively it tends to be removed. Albeit different gases can be utilized in this cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) is utilized most frequently.

This specific utilization of carbon dioxide probably could proceed or even increase from now on, as recent advances make it conceivable to move CO2 as froths and gels. To some, this could be a huge improvement as it would permit CO2 infusions to be used in areas distant from normally happening carbon dioxide repositories.

> Then again, there are grave worries about the proceeded with utilization of carbon dioxide in light of its hurtful effects on the environment. Currently, most countries are seeking alternative methods of energy that are more sustainable than CO2.

Other common EOR techniques incorporate pumping steam into the well to warm the oil and make it less thick. Comparable results can be accomplished through purported "fire flooding," which includes getting a fire going around the fringe of the oil repository to drive the leftover oil close to the well.

At long last, different polymers and other substance designs can be infused into the repository to reduce thickness and increase pressure, albeit these techniques are frequently restrictively costly.

## Utilizing Enhanced Oil Recovery Methods

Petroleum companies and researchers seek EOR for its capability to drag out the life of wells in proven or probable [oil fields](/oil-field). [Proven reserves](/proven-reserves) are those with a greater than 90% chance that oil will be recuperated, and probable reserves have an over half chance of recuperating petroleum.

Tragically, EOR techniques can deliver negative environmental side results, for example, making destructive synthetic compounds spill into the groundwater. One recent technique that could assist with diminishing these environmental risks is called plasma beating. Developed in Russia, plasma beat technology includes transmitting oil fields with low-energy emissions, along these lines bringing down their consistency similar as conventional EOR techniques.

Since plasma beating doesn't need infusing gases, synthetic substances, or intensity into the ground, it might end up being less environmentally destructive than the other current methods of oil recovery.

## Features
- Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the practice of separating oil from a well that has previously gone through the primary and secondary phases of oil recovery.
- Contingent upon the price of oil, EOR techniques may not be [economically viable](/economic_efficiency).
- EOR techniques can influence the environment negatively, however new innovations in the sector might assist with decreasing this impact from now on.
