# Momentum Fund
  Momentum has gotten a reputation as a frightful word, part of the way on the grounds that the strategy hasn't been effective in the past two or three years, and part of the way since it is an investment strategy zeroed in on stock movement more than the underlying companies.

In momentum investing, money managers are searching for stocks with earnings as well as price momentum in the somewhat short term, with little respect for the underlying company or its value compared with the stock price.
