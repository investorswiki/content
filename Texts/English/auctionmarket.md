# Auction Market
## What Is an Auction Market?

In an auction market, buyers enter [competitive bids](/competitivebid) and sellers submit competitive proposals simultaneously. The price at which a stock trades addresses the highest price that a buyer will pay and the most minimal price that a seller will acknowledge. Matching bids and offers are then paired together, and the orders are executed. The [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse) is an illustration of an auction market.

## Auction Market Process

The cycle associated with an auction market contrasts from the cycle in an over-the-counter [(OTC) market](/over-the-countermarket). On the NYSE, for instance, there are no direct [negotiations](/discussion) between individual buyers and sellers, while dealings happen in OTC trades. Most traditional auctions include various likely buyers or bidders, yet just a single seller, though auction markets for [securities](/security) have different buyers and numerous sellers, all hoping to at the same time make bargains.

## Double Auction Markets

A [auction](/auction) market otherwise called a double auction market, permits buyers and sellers to submit prices they consider acceptable to a rundown. At the point when a match between a buyer's price and a seller's asking price is found, the trade proceeds costing that much. Trades without matches won't be executed.

## Instances of the Auction Market Process

Envision that four buyers need to buy a share of company XYZ and make the accompanying bids: $10.00, $10.02, $10.03 and $10.06, individually. On the other hand, four sellers wish to sell shares of company XYZ, and these sellers submitted offers to sell their shares at the accompanying prices: $10.06, $10.09, $10.12 and $10.13, individually.

In this scenario, the individuals that made bids/offers for company XYZ at $10.06 will have their orders executed. All excess orders won't promptly be executed, and the current price of company XYZ will be $10.06.

## Treasury Auctions

The [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) holds [auctions](/bill-auction) to finance certain government financial activities. The Treasury auction is available to the public and different larger investment elements. These bids are submitted electronically and are separated into contending and noncompeting bids relying upon the person or entity who puts the recorded bid.

Noncompeting bids are addressed first in light of the fact that noncompetitive bidders are guaranteed to receive a foreordained amount of securities as a base and up to a maximum of $5 million. These are most generally placed by individual investors or those addressing small elements.

In competitive bidding, when the auction period shuts, the approaching bids are all explored to decide the triumphant price. Securities are sold to the contending bidders in view of the amount listed inside the bid. When the securities have been all sold, the leftover contending bidders won't receive any securities.
