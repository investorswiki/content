# Month to month Active Users (MAU)
## What Is Monthly Active Users (MAU)?

Month to month active users (MAU) is a [key performance indicator (KPI)](/kpi) utilized by social networking and different companies to count the number of unique users who visit a site inside the past month. Websites generally perceive month to month active users through an identification number, email address, or username.

MAU assists with estimating an online business' overall wellbeing and is the basis for ascertaining other website metrics. MAU is likewise valuable while surveying the viability of a business' marketing efforts and checking both present and possible clients' experience. Investors in the [social media](/social-media) industry pay consideration when companies report MAU, as a KPI can influence a social-media company's stock price.

## Who Uses MAU, and How?

All too frequently, companies don't utilize the very same boundaries while ascertaining MAU, and there are no industry standards for characterizing key terms, similar to "client" and "active." For this explanation, pundits of MAU accept that the [metric ](/metrics)creates unfair comparisons among contenders. Others think that MAU is helpful just in combination with other qualifying metrics, and some keep thinking about whether it is significant by any means.

As a quantitative assessment, MAU just tabulates the number of guests; there is no part that accounts for the depth, or quality, of a client's experience. While working out MAU, a few companies consider a client as somebody who just has gotten to their site. For different businesses, a client is one who has made a sign in and secret word. Despite everything for other people, an active client must meet certain requirements.

For instance, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, characterizes a month to month active client (MAU) as a registered and signed in client who has collaborated with Facebook through the company's website or a mobile gadget or utilized its Messenger application (and is likewise a registered client) in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. Meta likewise tracks daily active users (DAUs), who must meet similar requirements as MAUs to count, however meet those requirements on a daily, as opposed to month to month basis.

Twitter (TWTR) then again, no longer tracks month to month active users, however rather takes a gander at what it calls monetizable daily active use or users, or mDAU. Twitter characterizes mDAU as individuals, organizations, or different accounts "who signed in or were generally verified and gotten to Twitter on some random day through twitter.com or Twitter applications that are able to show ads." If Twitter's MAU does exclude similar engagement variables as Facebook's MAU, can the measurement yield an apt comparison of the companies' site utilization?

## Limits of MAU

The way that there are no uniform standards for the individual parts of MAU, and different metrics used to measure trends in social media, makes for an elusive playing field. In 2015, in response to suspicion about the precision of its MAU figures, Facebook reconsidered its definition of MAU, taking note of that it presently not counted individuals who were not active Facebook users, but rather who share content just through one more site that is integrated inside the Facebook login.

While apparently an apt continue on Facebook's part, this makes one wonder: Did the other social media websites additionally roll out this improvement in their MAU estimations?

For quite a long time, Twitter had been asking investors to judge the company on its **daily** active client (DAU), not MAU, growth. On its 2015 final quarter earnings call, Twitter was asked to make sense of why it had lost 4,000,000 MAUs during the previous quarter; the company ascribed the losses to the way that a large portion of the purported users didn't utilize Twitter, however had been counted when Apple's (AAPL) Safari web browser played out an automatic Twitter data pull.

Be that as it may, Twitter just started sharing its DAU data in February 2019. Switching from month to month to daily client counts showed that the company was acquiring, not losing users. Twitter said that it stopped sharing its MAU figure by and large in late 2019. One could ask: If Twitter really does stop sharing its MAU data, will its rivals do likewise?

## The Bottom Line

Some have contended unequivocally for resigning the MAU metric. Be that as it may, one company doing this all alone wouldn't be significant. In spite of the fact that it is actually the case that the varieties in client metrics can make it hard to compare social media companies, it's a horrible idea to get rid of MAO â€” until there is some kind of standardization in industry reporting, at any rate.

Likewise, on the grounds that companies' [business models](/businessmodel) are linked to their income creating efforts, understanding MAU trends might in any case be worth the time and exertion.
