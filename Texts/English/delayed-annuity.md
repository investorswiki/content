# Delayed Annuity
## What Is a Delayed Annuity?

A delayed annuity is an annuity where the principal payment isn't paid immediately, as in a [immediate annuity](/immediatepaymentannuity). A delayed annuity, all the more usually known as a [deferred annuity](/deferredannuity), is a type of life annuity that guarantees a dependable stream of cash payments to an annuitant til' the very end. Following the death of the annuitant, the cash benefit might be moved to a beneficiary or estate relying upon the options picked by the buyer.

Delayed annuities vary from most annuities in how premiums are paid into them, and how and when withdrawals are made. Delayed annuities might be funded through month to month contributions or a lump-sum payment. One way or the other, withdrawals don't happen straightforwardly in the wake of funding, similarly as with an immediate annuity. At times, a delayed annuity might be utilized as a method of parking money for later use with the benefit of an annuity's tax treatment.

## How a Delayed Annuity Works

A delayed annuity develops during the accumulation phase (otherwise called the deferral phase) and pays out benefits in the distribution phase. A few delayed or deferred annuities take into consideration a single premium payment that will develop during the accumulation phase (a [single-premium deferred annuity](/single-premium-deferred-annuity)). In an adaptable premium deferred annuity, an annuity buyer might make extra payments during the accumulation phase in the wake of making an initial premium payment.

A delayed annuity buyer need not at any point transform the money in the annuity into a series of income payments. Money might be removed on a case by case basis, in a lump-sum payment, or moved to another account or annuity. At the point when a delayed annuity is utilized along these lines, the annuity buyer holds control of the money, as opposed to being locked into payments by starting a withdrawal in a distribution or [annuitization](/annuitization) phase.

## Types of Delayed Annuities

Delayed annuities can arrive in various types relying upon the necessities of the buyer.

- A **fixed delayed annuity** (all the more regularly known as a fixed deferred annuity) is comparable in function to a certificate of deposit, then again, actually the tax on interest is deferred until withdrawal. Normally, the annuity writer will determine the guaranteed interest rate that the annuity will pay.

- A **longevity annuity** works like a normal life annuity yet will in general beginning a lot later than the common retirement age. The product acts like longevity insurance in that payments may not begin until the retired person's different assets are spent down.

## Special Considerations

Albeit delayed annuities permit the cash payments to be moved to a beneficiary following the death of the annuity owner, new rules came full circle in 2020 for retirement accounts.

With the passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act by the U.S. Congress in 2019, the stretch provision, which permitted non-spousal beneficiaries to take just the [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) from an inherited IRA, was disposed of. Under the new ruling, non-spousal beneficiaries who acquire an IRA account must pull out 100% of the funds in no less than 10 years following the death of the owner. Retirement accounts that have annuities in them would likewise should be cashed out in the span of 10 years of the owner's death under the ruling.

Fortunately in the event that you have an annuity in your employer-sponsored retirement plan, for example, a 401(k), the new ruling allows you to move the 401(k) annuity to your new employer's plan assuming you change occupations. Notwithstanding, the new law dispensed with a portion of the legal risks for insurance companies and annuity suppliers by diminishing the ability of account holders to sue them on the off chance that they can't respect the annuity payments.
