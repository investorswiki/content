# Share Certificate
## What is a share certificate?
A share certificate is a certificate of deposit issued by a credit union. It addresses a deposit that is made for a certain period of time that procures determined dividends over that period.
## More profound definition
A share certificate is like a certificate of deposit (CD). The main difference is that it is issued by a credit union. In practice, many credits unions call their share certificates CDs.
Share certificates are issued for a fixed period of time, generally between 90 days and five years. The interest rate or dividends will generally be marginally higher than different forms of savings.
The more extended the term of the share certificate, the higher the dividend.
Since share certificates are guaranteed by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), they are a safe and secure investment.
Since share certificates are like bonds and CDs, the money is tied up for the period of the certificate. Generally, it's challenging to early recover the certificate. In those examples where it is permitted, there are heavy early withdrawal punishments that discredit any earnings.
The dividend earned from a share certificate is fixed at the date of purchase and doesn't change during the duration. This is great assuming that interest rates fall, yet not all that great on the off chance that they rise.
Some credit unions really do offer share certificates with a variable rate that safeguards you during periods when rates rise, however you miss out when they fall. The dividend rate of share certificates is quoted as an annual percentage rate (APR), yet if you reinvest the interest, the genuine rate of return you get will be higher due to interest compounding.
