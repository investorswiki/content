# Indirect Tax
## What is an indirect tax?
An indirect tax is a tax that is forced on a transaction. Balance this with a [direct tax](/directtax), which is a tax forced directly on a property, an entity, or a person. Indirect taxes are regularly added to the prices of goods or services. Sales tax, value-added tax, [excise tax](/excisetax), and customs duties are instances of indirect taxes.
## More profound definition
Direct taxes are exacted on people or organizations. Indirect taxes are put on goods and services like imports, fuel, liquor, and cigarettes. Taxes like this are considered indirect in light of the fact that they are paid indirectly by the last consumer who partakes in the utilization of the goods or services, and are gathered by an intermediary, similar to a retailer or a manufacturer.
Customs duties are a form of indirect taxes applied to imported and sent out goods. Merchants and exporters can pass on the cost of the tax by implanting it in the price of the goods when they exchange them. Excise taxes are put on raw materials and paid for by manufacturers who consume the materials, and those taxes are embedded in the cost of the manufactured goods.
One of the most keen reactions of indirect taxes is that they are not equitable. The cost of an indirect tax continues as before paying little heed to how rich or poor the payer is; both pay a similar rate, yet the tax consumes relatively a greater amount of the poor person's income. Moreover, indirect taxes are normally "covered up" in the price that consumers are paying for that great or service.
## Indirect tax model
Gasoline taxes are indirect taxes that are embedded in the price per gallon. Consumers are never aware that they all pay customs taxes when they buy imported goods; customs taxes are put on goods and paid when the goods are traded or imported, and the cost of these taxes is given to the last consumer.
Practically all consumer goods carry sales taxes, albeit dissimilar to gas or customs taxes, sales taxes are generally itemized on bills. Services much of the time cause sales taxes: assuming a handyman fixes your sink, the parts used to make the repair carry a sales tax that is given to you. Frequently individuals are taxed on both the entire bill and parts.
