# Nominal Yield Spread
## What is a Nominal Yield Spread?

A nominal yield spread is the difference, communicated in basis points, between the Treasury and non-Treasury security of a similar maturity. It is the amount that, when added to the yield at one point on the Treasury yield curve addresses the discount factor that will make a security's cash flows equivalent to its current market price.

## Understanding Nominal Yield Spreads

Nominal [yield spreads](/yieldspread) are a convention much of the time utilized in pricing certain types of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). There are a wide range of types of MBSs, yet the majority of them trade at a nominal yield spread. These MBSs are priced at a spread over the interpolated Treasury curve at the point equivalent to their [weighted average life](/weightedaveragelife) (WAL).

A yield spread is a difference between the quoted rate of return on various debt instruments which frequently have changing maturities, credit ratings, and risk. The spread is direct to work out since you take away the yield of one from that of the other.

The nominal yield spread is thought of as straightforward since it includes surveying the difference between a corporate bond yield to maturity and the value of the equivalent Treasury bond having a similar timeline. You are contrasting the government and corporate forms of a similar bond with indistinguishable maturity terms.

A nominal yield spread characterizes one point along the whole Treasury yield curve to decide the spread, at that particular single point, where the price of the security and the current value of the security's cash flow are equivalent.

The convenience for nominal yield spreads accompanies certain disadvantages connected to it. For instance, the spread doesn't uncover underlying options or derivatives and their associated risks. It likewise doesn't consider spot maturities, which can have an effect on the overall demand, for the bond.

## Different Types of Yield Spreads

A [zero-volatility spread](/zspread) (Z-spread) measures the spread realized by the investor over the whole [Treasury spot-rate curve](/spot_rate_yield_curve), expecting the bond would be held until maturity. This technique can be a time-consuming cycle, as it requires a great deal of computations in light of trial and blunder. You would fundamentally begin by attempting one spread figure and run the computations to check whether the current value of the cash flows equals the bond's price. If not, you need to begin once again and keep attempting until the two values are equivalent.

A [option-adjusted spread](/optionadjustedspread) (OAS) changes over the difference between the fair price and market price, communicated as a dollar value, and converts that value into a yield measure. Interest rate volatility has an essential impact in the OAS formula. The option embedded in the security can impact the cash flows, which is something that must be thought about while computing the value of the security.

## Illustration of a Nominal Yield Spread

Assume the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) for a Treasury bond is 5% and the relating figure for a comparable corporate bond lapsing simultaneously is 7%. Then the nominal yield spread between the two bonds is 2%.

An illustration of the utilization of nominal yield spreads is their utilization in MBS pricing for derivatives guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), a government organization that gives loans to first-time property holders with low-to medium-pay. MBSs backed by GNMA guarantee full and timely repayment of principal with interest.
