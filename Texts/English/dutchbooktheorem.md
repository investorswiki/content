# Dutch Book Theorem
## What Is the Dutch Book Theorem?

The Dutch Book Theorem is a type of likelihood theory that hypothesizes that profit opportunities will emerge when conflicting probabilities that disregard the Bayesian estimation are assumed in a given setting.

## Figuring out the Dutch Book Theorem

The assumed probabilities can be established in [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance), and are a direct consequence of human blunder in working out the likelihood of an event happening. As such, the theory states that when a wrong assumption is made about the probability that an event will happen, a profit opportunity will emerge for an intermediary.

For instance, expect there is one insurance company and 100 individuals in a given house insurance market. In the event that the insurance company predicts that the likelihood that a homeowner will require insurance is 5%, yet all homeowners anticipate that the likelihood of requiring insurance is 10%, then, at that point, the insurance company can charge something else for home insurance. This is on the grounds that the insurance company realizes individuals will pay more for insurance than what will be required. The profit comes from the difference between premiums charged for insurance and the costs the insurance company brings about through settling insurance claims.

## Gambling Usage of the Dutch Book Theorem

The Dutch Book Theorem is frequently associated with gambling, particularly betting on horse racing, and the primary utilization of the word was in an insightful journal, **The Journal of Symbolic Logic.** Author R. Sherman Lehman composed that on the off chance that a bettor isn't careful in setting up their wagers, a rival can win money from them regardless of the situation.

Professional bettors, particularly bookmakers, know to keep away from its occurrence no matter what. They allude to this losing book as a "Dutch book." In summary, the Dutch Book Theorem concerns the conditions under which a set of wagers guarantees a net loss aside, or a Dutch Book.

As an illustration suppose that a bookie takes in a pool of $100 from individuals wagering on a horse race and the chances are that the payouts will be $100, in any case on the off chance that a certain pony wins or not. The bookie took in $100 and will pay out $100, so he breaks even. To cure this, the bookie, broker or racetrack, frequently takes a percentage off the top from the pool and consequently will pay out the total amount minus some percentage.

For instance, Las Vegas sports bookies normally set the Dutch book so the chances are equivalent to a likelihood of 1.05; i.e., they skim 5% from the pool of wagers and consequently lay out a Dutch book. In the event that a bookie sets the skim too high, they may be gotten short assuming the bettors win big.

## Highlights
- The Dutch Book Theorem is frequently associated with gambling and empowers professional bettors to keep away from losses.
- The Dutch Book Theorem is a likelihood theory which states that profit opportunities will emerge when conflicting probabilities are assumed in a given setting.
- The assumed probabilities are a direct consequence of human blunder in computing the likelihood of an event happening.
