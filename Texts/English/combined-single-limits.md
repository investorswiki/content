# Combined Single Limits
## What Are Combined Single Limits?

Combined single limits are a provision of an insurance policy that limits the coverage for all parts of a claim to a single dollar amount. A combined single limit policy has a maximum dollar amount that covers any combination of wounds or property damage in an episode. A combined single limit can likewise be utilized to cover claims for more than one person in an occurrence.

For instance, the policy could state that the insurer will pay up to "x" dollars for a single claim; whether or not the parts of the claim are all connected with one person's wounds, or whether there are three harmed parties addressed by the claim. The combined single limit maximizes at the stated dollar amount one way or the other. Combined single limit policies are useful in light of the fact that they permit insurance companies to apply the maximum amount of coverage to where it's required.

## How Combined Single Limits Work

Combined single limit contracts likewise called single limit contracts are regularly utilized with automobile insurance. The combined single limit means there's a maximum amount of money that is paid out, which covers all parts of damage, for example, real injury and property damage. Notwithstanding, the limit would cover all individuals associated with the accident or the claim, meaning the maximum amount of coverage would be split between those included.

## Combined Single Limit versus Split Limit

Something contrary to a combined single limit is a split limit, which states different maximum dollar amounts that the insurer will pay for various parts of a claim.

A split limit policy coverage breaks up the payout into three areas of coverage:

- Substantial injury per person
- Substantial injury for the episode
- Property damage

For instance, a policy with a combined single limit could state that it will pay a maximum of $300,000 per episode. Then again, a policy with [split limits](/split-limits) could pay $100,000 per person per occurrence for substantial injury, with a maximum payout of $300,000 per episode. Assuming one person looks for $250,000 in damages for their wounds, the combined single limit policy will cover the whole amount of $250,000. Be that as it may, the maximum payout under the split limit policy would be $100,000. The main way the split limit policy would pay $300,000 is assuming three distinct individuals each had $100,000 in claims.
