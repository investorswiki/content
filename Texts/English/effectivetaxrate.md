# Effective Tax Rate
## What Is the Effective Tax Rate?

The effective tax rate is the percent of their income that an individual or a [corporation](/corporation) pays in taxes. The effective tax rate for individuals is the average rate at which their [earned income](/earnedincome), like wages, and [unearned income](/unearnedincome), like stock dividends, are taxed. The effective tax rate for a corporation is the average rate at which its pre-tax profits are taxed, while the statutory tax rate is the legal percentage laid out by law.

## Understanding the Effective Tax Rate

An individual can work out their effective tax rate by taking a gander at their [1040 form](/1040) and partitioning the number on line 16, the "Total Tax," by the number on line 11(b), the "Taxable Income." For corporations, the effective tax rate is processed by separating total tax expenses by the company's earnings before taxes.

Communicated as formulas, the effective tax rates (ETR) for individuals and corporations seem to be this:

 **           For an individual**: ETR = Total Tax \u00f7 Taxable Income

 **           For a corporation**: ETR = Total Tax \u00f7 Earnings Before Taxes

The effective tax rate regularly alludes just to federal income taxes and doesn't consider state and neighborhood income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, or different types of taxes an individual could pay. To decide their overall effective tax rate, individuals can include their total tax burden and gap that by their taxable income. This calculation can be helpful while attempting to compare the effective tax rates of at least two individuals, or what a specific individual could pay in taxes in the event that they lived in a high-tax versus a low-tax state â€” a consideration for some individuals thinking about migrating in retirement.

> Investors might utilize effective tax rate as a productivity marker for a company, yet deciding the justification for year-to-year changes in the ETR can be troublesome.

## Marginal versus Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate is a more accurate representation of an individual's or alternately corporation's overall tax liability than their [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate), and it is commonly lower. While considering a marginal versus an effective tax rate, bear at the top of the priority list that the marginal tax rate alludes to the highest tax bracket into which their income falls.

In a graduated or [progressive income-tax](/progressivetax) system, similar to the one in the United States, income is taxed at contrasting rates that rise as income hits certain thresholds. Two individuals or companies with income in a similar upper marginal tax bracket might wind up with totally different effective tax rates, contingent upon the amount of their income was in the top bracket.

## Illustration of an Effective Tax Rate

Envision, for instance, a graduated tax system where income under $100,000 is taxed at 10%, income somewhere in the range of $100,000 and $300,000 is taxed at 15% and income more than $300,000 is taxed at 25%. Presently consider two individuals who both hit the upper tax bracket of 25%, albeit one had a taxable income of $500,000, while the other had a taxable income of $360,000.

The two individuals would pay 10% on their first $100,000 of income, or $10,000. Both would then pay 15% percent on their income somewhere in the range of $100,000 and $300,000, or $30,000 (15% of $200,000).

At last, both would likewise pay 25% on their earnings more than the $300,000 threshold. For the individual with $360,000 in taxable income, that would come to $15,000 (25% of $60,000). Yet, for the individual with $500,000 in taxable income, the tax would be $50,000 (25% of $200,000). Their total tax obligations would be $55,000 and $90,000, individually.

While the two individuals could express they're in the 25% bracket, the one with the higher income has an effective tax rate of 18% ($90,000 in tax separated by $500,000 in income), while the other's effective tax rate is 15.3% ($55,000 partitioned by $360,000).
