# Oversold
## What Is Oversold?

The term oversold refers to a condition where an asset has traded lower in price and has the potential at a cost bounce. An oversold condition can last for quite a while, and therefore being oversold doesn't mean a price rally will come soon, or by any stretch of the imagination. Numerous [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) identify oversold and [overbought](/overbought) levels. These indicators base their assessment on where the price is currently trading relative to prior prices. [Fundamentals](/fundamentals) can likewise be used to assess whether an asset is potentially oversold and has deviated from its typical value metrics.

## What Does Oversold Tell You?

Oversold to a fundamental trader means an asset it trading well below its typical value metrics. Technical analysts are typically referring to an indicator reading when they mention oversold. Both are substantial approaches, albeit the two groups are utilizing different tools to determine whether an asset is oversold.

### Fundamentally Oversold

Fundamentally oversold stocks (or any asset) are those that investors feel are trading below their true value. This could be the result of terrible news regarding the company in question, a poor outlook for the company proceeding, an undesirable industry, or a drooping overall market.

Generally, a common indicator of a stock's value has been the P/E ratio. Analysts and traders use publicly reported financial results or [earnings estimates](/earningsestimate) to identify the appropriate price for a particular stock. On the off chance that a stock's P/E dips to the lower part of its historic range, or falls below the average P/E of the sector, investors might see the stock as undervalued. This might present a buying opportunity for long-term investing.

For example, a stock that has historically had a P/E of 10 to 15, and which is currently trading at a P/E of five might signal investors to check the company out. On the off chance that the company is as yet strong the stock might be oversold and a decent buy candidate. Careful analysis is needed however, as there could be valid justifications why investors presently not like the company however much they once did.

### Technically Oversold

Traders can likewise use technical [indicators](/indicator) to establish oversold levels. A technical indicator just glances at the current price relative to prior prices. It does not take into account fundamental data.

George Lane's stochastic oscillator, which he developed during the 1950s, examines recent price movements to identify changes in a stock's momentum and price direction. The RSI measures the power behind price movements over a recent period, typically 14 days.

A low RSI, generally below 30, signals traders that a stock might be oversold. Essentially the indicator is saying that the price is trading in the lower third of its recent [price range](/range). This isn't to say the price will bounce immediately. Numerous traders trust that the indicator will begin heading higher before buying since oversold conditions can last a long time. For example, a trader might sit tight for the oversold RSI to move back **above** 30 before buying. This shows that the price was oversold yet is currently starting to rise.

Some traders use pricing channels like [Bollinger Bands](/bollingerbands) to spot oversold areas. On a chart, Bollinger Bands are positioned at a multiple of a stock's [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) above and below a [exponential moving average](/ema). When the price reaches the lower band, it could be oversold. Once more traders typically hold on until the price begins rising again before buying.

## Examples of Oversold Indicators and Fundamentals

The chart example shows a price chart with two indicators below it. Top indicator is a RSI, and the one below it is P/E.

On the RSI, bolts have been placed where the RSI dropped below 30 and afterward moved back above it. These eventual possible buy points based on recovery from an oversold condition. Some of these signals resulted in the price going higher, while others saw the price continue lower for a time.

The oversold level of the P/E will shift by stock, since each stock has its own P/E range it tends to travel in. For this stock, buying near a P/E of 10 typically presented a decent buying opportunity as the price headed higher from that point.

## The Difference Between Oversold and Overbought

Assuming oversold is when an asset is trading in the lower portion of its recent price range or is trading near lows based on fundamental data, then [overbought](/overbought) is the opposite. An overbought technical indicator reading appears when the price of an asset is trading in the upper portion of its recent price range. Additionally, an overbought fundamental reading appears when the asset is trading at the high end of its fundamental ratios. This doesn't mean the asset ought to be sold. It is just an alert to investigate what is happening.

## Limitations of Using Oversold Readings

Oversold is mistakenly viewed by some traders as a buy signal. Instead, it is more of an alert. It lets traders realize that an asset is trading in the lower portion of its recent price range, or is trading at a lower fundamental ratio than it typically does. This doesn't mean the asset ought to be bought. Many stocks that continue to fall look cheap right down. This can happen because most oversold readings are based on past performance. Assuming that investors see an inauspicious future for a stock or other asset, it might continue to be sold off even however it looks cheap based on historical standards.

Even on the off chance that a stock or other asset is a decent buy, it can remain oversold for quite a while before the price begins to move higher. To this end numerous traders watch for oversold readings, however at that point trust that the price will begin moving up before buying based on the oversold signal.

## Highlights
- Oversold conditions are identified by technical indicators, for example, the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic oscillator, as well as others.
- Fundamentals can likewise highlight an oversold asset by comparing current values to prior values in terms of price/earnings (P/E) and forward P/E, for example.
- Oversold conditions can last for quite a while, so prudent traders trust that the price will base out and begin to move higher before buying.
- Oversold is a subjective term. Since traders and analysts all use different tools, some might see an oversold asset while others see an asset that has further to fall.
