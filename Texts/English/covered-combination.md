# Covered Combination
## What Is a Covered Combination?

The term covered combination alludes to an options strategy that includes the simultaneous sale of a [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) call and put with a similar expiration dates on a security owned by the investor. Put essentially, a covered combination is a [covered call](/coveredcall) and a [short put](/short-put) position combined together.

Investors can utilize this strategy to receive premium income through the sale of the call and put. In exchange, they face the risk challenges expanding their position in the stock should its price decline below the strike price of the put by the expiration date.

## How Covered Combinations Work

Covered combinations are basically two different investment strategies moved into one. As referenced over, these strategies include selling a covered out-of-the-cash call and an out-of-the-cash put — the two of which have a similar expiration date — simultaneously. An OTM [call](/call) option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) higher than the underlying [asset's](/asset) market price, while an OTM [put's](/put) strike price is the inverse — it's lower than the asset's price.

Covered combinations are additionally called covered combos. They give [premium income](/premium-income) — the proceeds earned from selling options contracts — from two sources.

## Illustration of Covered Combination

Here is a theoretical guide to demonstrate how covered combinations work. We should expect an investor possesses stock from Company XYZ which trades at $30 per share. They sell a call option on Company XYZ with a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $33 per share, while simultaneously selling a put option with a strike price of $27 per share. Both the call and put [expire](/expirationdate) in 90 days.

The options terminate worthless for the party who buys them toward the finish of the three-month time frame — gave XYZ stays around $30 per share. Yet, the investor, who actually possesses the stock, can pocket the [premiums](/premium).

Yet, assuming the price of Company XYZ's stock transcends $33, the investor is forced to sell their stock at $33, since the person who bought the call option will probably [exercise](/exercise) the option. In this case, the investor profits up to $33 on the stock, yet in addition will keep both premiums since the put option terminates worthless for the person who buys it.

In the event that the stock price falls below $27 per [share](/shares), the put option kicks in. The person who buys the put [option](/option) will try to sell the stock at $27, and that means the investor who sold the option must buy more stock at $27. For each option they sold, they should buy 100 shares at $27. At any rate, this might be beneficial to buy more stock at $27. With the covered combination, they get the stock they need with the additional benefit of getting the premiums. The major risk in this scenario is assuming that the stock keeps falling. The investor presently has a bigger position in a declining asset.
