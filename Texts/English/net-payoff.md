## Figuring out Net Payoff

Net payoff is a term used to portray the "all in" gain or loss experienced after a sales transaction has been completed. While considering the sale of an asset, the seller ought to think about the sale price, yet how much the asset cost over its lifetime and the amount they will really receive toward the finish of the transaction after commissions and some other associated taxes or fees are deducted from the proceeds.

For instance, assuming Amy sells her home for $250,000, she should take away her mortgage payoff amount, real estate commission and any settlement fees from the $250,000 to determine her net payoff. Assume she actually owes $75,000 on her mortgage, the real estate commission (counting both the purchaser's and seller's agent) is 5%, or $12,500, and her closing costs are another 5%, or another $12,500. That means $100,000 is deducted from the $250,000 and Amy's net payoff is $150,000.

As another model, think about the sale of certain shares of stock. The net payoff would be the amount received for the sale minus the trade commission. So if an individual sold 20 shares of company XYZ at $15 per share for $300, and the online discount broker commission fee was $10, the net payoff would be $290.
