# Measuring Natural Gas in MCF
## What Is MCF?

MCF is a contraction derived from the Roman numeral M for 1,000, put along with cubic feet (CF) to measure a quantity of natural gas. For instance, a natural gas well that produces 400 MCF of gas each day operates with a daily [production rate](/production-rate) of 400,000 cubic feet. In terms of energy output, 1,000 cubic feet (MCF) of gas is equivalent to around a million BTU (British Thermal Units). One BTU is the amount of intensity required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at sea level (which is generally equivalent to a kitchen match).

Many individuals mistakenly think that M addresses the English word for million, yet that isn't the case. 1,000,000 cubic feet of gas is rather signified as MMCF, in which the two Ms mean "1,000 thousand" or a million, with every M addressing three zeros.

## Grasping MCF

MCF is the conventional method for measuring natural gas in the United States, which utilizes the magnificent measuring system. In Europe, where the decimal measuring standard is utilized, the truncation most regularly utilized is thousand of cubic meters or MCM. Oil and gas financial analysts should be especially careful while examining companies' quarterly outcomes to try not to stir up different units. For instance, ignoring the fact that U.S is very simple. companies will report natural gas measurements in MCF, while European companies often report them in MCM. This makes all in all a difference since 1 MCM = 35.3 MCF.

To assist analysts with dealing with these reporting differences, a few companies give analysts an estimated conversion factor guide. In these aides, there are regularly six specific conversion factors for natural gas (cubic meters, cubic feet, lots of oil equivalent, lots of liquefied natural gas, BTU, and [barrels of oil equivalent](/barrelofoilequivalent)).

## Special Considerations

 The greater part of the major international oil and gas companies give standardized reports to help analysts and investors accurately evaluate these figures. This is incompletely a regulatory requirement, with the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) specifying that foreign companies with stock listed on U.S. exchanges file standardized reports on an annual basis, called a 20-F. This is equivalent to the 10-K filing for U.S. companies and gives investors oil and gas production and reserve statistics distributed with magnificent measurements to permit like-for-like comparison.

Investors in the emerging markets of Russia, Africa, or Latin America often receive reports with data addressed in the decimal standard, which is a global measurement system. Analysts of these companies should utilize conversion tables to quantify and compare them to additional sophisticated international administrators accurately.

## Features
- MCF is a conventional natural gas measurement that is utilized basically in the United States, where the majestic measuring system is standard.
- The comparable term for natural gas measurement in Europe, where the decimal standard is utilized, is MCM.
- MCF is a truncation that consolidates the Roman numeral M, as a substitute for the number 1,000, with the term cubic feet (CF).
