Interest rate caps are generally placed on [mortgage rates](/first_mortgage) to protect borrowers against extreme rate gets around the life of the loan. Since they are initial, the rate cap is subject to change after the initial period has closed.

## Understanding Initial Interest Rate Caps

Initial interest rate caps must be found on adjustable-rate products, as [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm), where the interest rate goes through scheduled changes over the lifetime of the loan. Fixed-rate products don't have a cap since they don't change. The rate at the beginning of the loan continues as before until the loan is paid off, or there is a change to the terms of the note, for example, during modification or refinance.

Products with variable interest rates were well known in the mid 2000s during the [subprime](/subprime) mortgage boom. Numerous homeowners immediately found themselves in a tough situation when their interest rates hopped after the initial fixed period. The draw of an adjustable-rate mortgage was that the initial fixed-rate was generally lower than the interest rates offered on fixed-rate products at that point.

Borrowers were anxious to exploit these lower rates, with the expectation that they could refinance again before their rate adjusted. The initial interest rate cap was in place to shield homeowners from a large payment shock, with the expectation that the rates would slowly increase over the long haul.

Tragically, the market crashed and property values plunged, passing on numerous homeowners without the ability to [refinance](/refinance) out of progressively exorbitant mortgage products. Numerous borrowers defaulted on their mortgages compounding the subprime crash.
