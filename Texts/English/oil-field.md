# Oil Field
## What Is an Oil Field?

An oil field is a plot of land utilized to separate petroleum, like natural gas or [crude oil,](/crude-oil) from the ground. Albeit some challenge the specific starting points of oil, most believe petroleum to be a "non-renewable energy source" made from dead organic material frequently found in old seabeds great many meters below the surface of the earth.

Distinguishing reasonable oil fields is an important piece of the [upstream](/upstream) oil industry.

## Understanding Oil Fields

An oil field comprises of a repository of petroleum derivative found deep in the rough layers of the Earth, where [hydrocarbons](/hydrocarbon) have become caught. An impermeable, or fixing rock layer covers the repository keeping in one piece over centuries. Normally, oil industry experts utilize the term "oil field" with an implied assumption of economic size. For example, an oil field might be discovered containing 1,000,000 barrels of oil, equivalent to the market price of oil increased by its size.

As of now, there are in excess of 65,000 oil fields around the world, with a significant number of the largest situated in the Middle East where a huge number of oil fields have been discovered. Notwithstanding the large number of fields 94% of realized reserves are moved in less than 1500 major oil fields. The areas of oil fields have been the beginning of past international contentions and environmental worries. Oil may likewise be discovered underneath the ocean floor, where deep-ocean rigs investigate and extricate these fields.

## Entanglements of Establishing an Oil Field

Laying out an oil field can be a titanic accomplishment of logistics, and can be a hazardous prospect in the event that an oil field demonstrates be less useful than anticipated. Exploration will frequently incorporate laying out the essential infrastructure important for what can be many years of extraction, production, and maintenance. [Integrated oil companies](/integrated-oil-gas-organization) frequently contain whole divisions that are responsible for infrastructure construction and particular services that are required to operate a beneficial oil field. Oil fields are specked with an assortment of extraction equipment which incorporates drilling rigs, offshore platforms, pump jacks, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. There may likewise be exploratory wells examining the edges, pipelines to move the oil somewhere else, and support facilities.

In recent years, new advances in oil [exploration and production](/exploration-production-organization) have decisively increased the productivity levels of oil fields. These incorporate horizontal drilling, hydraulic drilling, [hydraulic fracturing](/hydraulic-fracturing), or "deep earth drilling", and the utilization of the material proppant. Proppant is a combination of water and sand used to keep the cracked pathways to the wellbore clear.

These advancements, combined with advances like seismic monitoring, have assisted with expanding oil field productivity rates and contributed to an overabundance in oil supply, which drove oil prices down. Companies that work in oil fields stay zeroed in on mechanical development to bring down their production costs in the current price-constrained environment.

## Illustration of an Oil Field

Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia, what began production in 1951, is by a long shot the largest oil field uncovered to date. It has yielded in excess of 80 billion barrels of "dark gold" through 2018. There are additionally offshore oil fields, and the Safaniya field is the world's largest. Situated in the Persian Gulf off the Saudi Arabian coast, the Safaniya field is remembered to hold in excess of 50 billion barrels of oil.

## Features
- Oil exploration to discover new drilling destinations can costly and unsafe, yet additionally very lucrative in the event that a large reserve is distinguished.
- An oil field is a land parcel underneath which non-renewable energy sources can be extricated for economic value.
- The vast majority of the world's oil is moved in oil fields situated in the Middle East, alongside other large deposits discovered underneath the ocean's surface.
