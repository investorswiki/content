>

This calculation just thinks about the main year of business. On the off chance that after the primary year, costs reduction to 10,000 the economic profit outlook would improve for future years.

>

Assuming that a company produces $10 per unit from selling shirts with a $5 cost for every unit, then its gross [profit](/profit) per unit for shirts is $5. Be that as it may, on the off chance that they might have possibly delivered shorts with revenue of $10 and costs of $2 then there could be an opportunity cost of $8 too:

>
> $10 - $5 - $8 = - $3
>

Taking everything into account, the company might have earned $3 more per unit assuming they had created shorts rather than shirts. In this way, the - $3 per unit is viewed as an economic loss.
