# Voluntary Compliance
## What is voluntary compliance?
Voluntary compliance is the assumption that taxpayers will report the entirety of their income and accept tax deductions as precisely as could really be expected.
## More profound definition
The U.S. tax system works on the principle of voluntary compliance. Rather than the IRS finishing tax returns for each and every taxpayer, every taxpayer must complete their own return.
The possibility of voluntary compliance doesn't lie in that frame of mind of the tax return, yet rather in how an individual reports income or claims deductions.
The IRS anticipates that taxpayers should follow the tax code as they complete their tax returns. Due to the complexity of the tax code, the IRS furnishes taxpayers with various timetables and rules.
Taxpayers ought to utilize these things to see what deductions or credits they fit the bill for. The taxpayer likewise can utilize this information to track down the right filing status or to check whether a person qualifies as the taxpayer's dependent.

## Voluntary compliance model
When it is tax time, the taxpayer ought to stick to voluntary compliance when finishing up a tax return.
For instance, expect that a taxpayer has income from various sources to report on their tax return. The taxpayer gets a W-2 that reports income received from an employer.
However, assuming that the taxpayer accomplishes seasonal work as an afterthought for extra income, the entity that the taxpayer works for may not be required to send the taxpayer a form that reports the income. In that example, it really depends on the taxpayer to willfully agree with IRS regulations and report the income on the tax return.
In the event that the taxpayer chooses not to report the income, the IRS might audit the tax return and recalculate the taxpayer's income tax obligation.

## Features
- Consequently, it must accept that taxpayers will deliberately agree to the best of their capacities.
- Checks and balances like W-2 forms are in place to deter resistance.
- The U.S. government found right off the bat that auditing each individual tax return is unimaginable.
