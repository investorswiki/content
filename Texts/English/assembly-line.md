# Assembly Line
## What Is an Assembly Line?

An assembly line is a production cycle that breaks the production of a decent into steps that are completed in a pre-characterized sequence. Assembly lines are the most normally involved method in the [mass production](/mass-production) of products. They reduce labor costs on the grounds that unskilled workers are prepared to perform specific tasks. Instead of hire a skilled craftsperson to put together a whole household item or vehicle engine, companies hire workers just to add a leg to a stool or a fastener to a machine.

## Understanding Assembly Lines

An assembly line is where semi-completed products move from one workstation to another. Parts are included sequence until the last assembly is created. Today, automated assembly lines are by machines with negligible human supervision.

The presentation of the assembly line definitely impacted how goods were manufactured. Credit Henry Ford, who set up an assembly line in 1908 to make his Model T cars. Before, workers would collect a product (or a large part of it) in place, frequently with one worker finishing all responsibilities associated with the product's creation.

Assembly lines, then again, have workers (or machines) complete a specific task on the product as it proceeds with the production line as opposed to complete a series of tasks. This increments proficiency by expanding the amount a worker could create relative to the cost of labor.

Figuring out what individual tasks must be completed, when they should be completed, and who will complete them is a critical step in laying out an effective assembly line. Muddled products, like cars, must be broken down into parts that machines and workers can rapidly collect.

Companies utilize a design for assembly (DFA) approach to break down a product and its design to decide assembly order and recognize issues that can influence each task. Each task is then arranged as one or the other manual, robotic, or automatic, and is then assigned to individual stations along the manufacturing plant floor.

## Special Considerations for Assembly Lines

Companies can likewise design products considering their assembly, alluded to as concurrent engineering. This permits the company to fabricate another product that has been designed considering mass production, with the tasks, task order, and assembly line format previously foreordained. This can essentially reduce the lead time between the initial product design release and the end result roll out.

Modern assembly lines consolidate digital technology with human input. New sorts of sensors and IIoT gadgets collect data from humans and machines in real time. Advanced robotics, collaborative automation, and more sophisticated software permit humans to work progressively with machines on assembly lines.

## Features
- Assembly lines reduce labor costs on the grounds that unskilled workers are prepared to perform specific tasks instead of build a whole product unit.
- An assembly line is a production cycle by which the assembling of a decent is a sequence of steps completed in a pre-characterized sequence.
- Assembly lines are the most regularly utilized mass production method.
