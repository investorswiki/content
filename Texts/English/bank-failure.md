# Bank Failure
## What Is Bank Failure?

A bank failure is the closing of a wiped out bank by a federal or state regulator. The comptroller of the currency has the power to close national banks; banking commissioners in the particular states close state-contracted banks. Banks close when they are unable to meet their obligations to depositors and others. At the point when a bank fails, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) covers the insured portion of a depositor's balance, including money market accounts.

## Figuring out Bank Failures

A bank fails when it can't meet its financial obligations to [creditors](/leaser) and depositors. This could happen on the grounds that the bank being referred to has become indebted, or in light of the fact that it no longer has an adequate number of liquid assets to satisfy its payment obligations.

The most common reason for bank failure happens when the value of the bank's [assets](/asset) falls to below the market value of the bank's [liabilities](/absolute liabilities), which are the bank's obligations to creditors and depositors. This could happen in light of the fact that the bank loses too much on its investments. It's not generally imaginable to foresee when a bank will fail.

## What Happens When a Bank Fails?

At the point when a bank fails, it might try to borrow money from other [solvent](/dissolvability) banks to pay its depositors. In the event that the failing bank can't pay its depositors, a bank panic could follow in which depositors run on the bank trying to get their money back. This can exacerbate things for the failing bank, by contracting its [liquid assets](/liquidasset) as depositors pull out cash from the bank. Starting from the creation of the FDIC, the federal government has insured bank deposits up to $250,000 in the U.S.

At the point when a bank fails, the FDIC assumes control and will either sell the failed [bank](/bank) to a more dissolvable bank or assume control over the operation of the bank itself. Ideally, depositors who have money in the failed bank will experience no change in their experience of utilizing the bank; they'll in any case approach their money and ought to have the option to utilize their [debit cards](/debitcard) and checks as normal. If a failed bank is sold to another bank, account holders automatically become customers of that bank and may receive new checks and debit cards.

## Instances of Bank Failures

During the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the greatest bank failure in U.S. history happened when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, closed its entryways. Another large bank failure had happened just a couple of months sooner when IndyMac was seized. The subsequent all-time largest closure was the $34 billion failure of Continental Illinois in 1984. The FDIC keeps a cutting-edge rundown of failed banks on its website.

## Special Considerations

The FDIC was made in 1933 by the Banking Act (frequently alluded to as the Glass-Steagall Act). In the years quickly prior, which denoted the beginning of the [Great Depression](/great_depression), one-third of American banks had failed. During the 1920s, before the Black Tuesday crash of 1929, an average of around 70 banks had failed every year cross country.

During the initial 10 months of the Great Depression, 744 banks failed, and during 1933 alone, around 4,000 American banks failed. When the FDIC was made, American depositors had lost $140 billion due to bank failures, and without federal deposit insurance protecting these deposits, bank customers had not a chance of getting their money back.

## Features
- At the point when a bank fails, expecting the FDIC safeguards its deposits and tracks down a bank to take it over, its customers can probably keep utilizing their accounts, debit cards, and online banking tools.
- Bank failures are frequently challenging to foresee and the FDIC doesn't declare when a bank is set to be sold or is going under.
- It might require months or years to recover uninsured deposits from a failed bank.
