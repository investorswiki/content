## What Is Smart Beta?

Smart beta investing combines the benefits of [passive investing](/passiveinvesting) and the advantages of [active investing](/activeinvesting) strategies.

Smart beta defines a set of investment strategies that emphasize the use of alternative index construction rules to traditional [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization)- based indices. Smart beta emphasizes capturing investment factors or [market inefficiencies](/inefficientmarket) in a rules-based and transparent way. The increased popularity of smart beta is linked to a desire for portfolio risk management and diversification along factor dimensions, as well as seeking to enhance [risk-adjusted returns](/riskadjustedreturn) above cap-weighted indices.

Smart beta strategies seek to passively follow indices, while additionally considering alternative weighting schemes, for example, [volatility](/volatility), liquidity, quality, value, size and momentum. That is because smart beta strategies are implemented like typical index strategies in that the index rules are set and transparent.

Funds might take a thematic approach to manage this risk by zeroing in on mispricing created by investors seeking short-term gains, for example.

Managers may likewise choose to create or follow an index that weights investments as per fundamentals, for example, [earnings](/earnings) or book value, rather than market capitalization.

Alternatively, managers might use a risk-weighted approach to smart beta that involves the establishment of an index based upon assumptions of future volatility. For instance, this might involve an analysis of historical performance and the [correlation](/correlation) between an investment's risk relative to its return. The manager must evaluate the number of assumptions they that will build into the index and can approach the index by expecting a combination of different correlations.
