## What Is a Broad-Based Weighted Average?

The broad-based weighted average accounts for all equity recently issued and currently going through issue. At the hour of the [secondary offering](/secondaryoffering), the company will adjust the value of the preferred shares to another weighted average price utilizing the broad-based weighted average calculation.
