# Forward Pricing
## What Is Forward Pricing?

Forward pricing is an industry standard for [mutual funds](/mutualfund) developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that requires [investment companies](/investmentcompany) to price fund transactions as per the day's end [net asset value](/nav) (NAV), otherwise called the forward price. Rule 22(c)(1) gives the basis to this pricing and is known as the forward pricing rule. Forward pricing assists with alleviating shareholder dilution and accommodates more efficient mutual fund operations.

## Grasping Forward Pricing

Forward pricing is the standard methodology for which open-end mutual funds are transacted. Forward pricing basically alludes to [open-end mutual funds](/open-endfund) which are not traded on an exchange with real-time pricing. Open-end mutual funds are bought and sold from the mutual fund company. Investors can buy them through go-betweens like financial advisors, brokers, and discount brokerage platforms.

Rule 22(c)(1) of the [Investment Advisors Act of 1940](/investadvact) expects that mutual funds be transacted at their forward price. Mutual funds price their shares once per day after the close of the market. The closing price is called the net asset value (NAV). The per-share NAV is equivalent to the total market value of assets minus the mutual fund's liabilities partitioned by the number of shares outstanding. All underlying securities are recorded at their daily closing market value.

Investors mentioning transactions will trade at the mutual fund's next forward price. The forward pricing rule expects that transactions be founded on forward prices for the best proficiency. Consequently, forward pricing requires mutual fund accounting to take careful consideration for the timing of fund transactions. Mutual funds transacted during the trading day will receive the end of day NAV as their transaction price. Mutual funds transacted after the market's close will receive the next day's forward price. With forward pricing, a mutual fund transaction can't occur at a previous NAV. Its price must be founded on not entirely settled after receipt of an order.

## Special Considerations

The SEC initiated Rule 22(c)(1) to relieve the risk of shareholder dilution that can happen from backward pricing methods. The SEC has additionally added swing pricing systems for daily NAV computations which came full circle in November 2018. Swing pricing point by point in Section 22(c)(1) under provisions (a)(3) permit mutual fund companies to possibly account for transactions costs of the fund to better deal with the fund's liquidity risks. Companies must lay out swing pricing policies that are point by point in a fund's prospectus.

## Features
