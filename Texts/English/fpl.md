# Federal Poverty Level (FPL)
## What Is the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)?

The federal poverty level (FPL), or the "poverty line", is an economic measure used to choose whether the [income](/income) level of an individual or family qualifies them for certain federal benefits and programs. The [Department of Health and Human Services](/us-department-wellbeing and-human-services-hhs) (HHS) refreshes its poverty guidelines, representing the set least amount of income that a family needs for food, clothing, transportation, shelter, and different necessities, one time each year, adjusted for inflation.

The federal poverty level (FPL) ought not be mistaken for the poverty threshold, which is another important federal measure that really characterizes what [poverty](/poverty) is. The poverty threshold is essentially utilized for statistical purposes and to assist with working out poverty guidelines.

## Understanding the Federal Poverty Level

Every year, the [US Census Bureau](/bureauofcensus) issues a public report on the level of poverty in the country. The report gives an estimate of the number of individuals that are poor; the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level; the poverty distribution by age, sex, identity, location, and so forth; and the level of [income inequality](/income-inequality).

The federal poverty level (FPL) is regularly issued annually in January by the, not set in stone by [household income](/household_income) and size. Inside its annual report, the HHS shows the total cost required by the average person each year to cover fundamental necessities like food, utilities, and accommodation. This number is adjusted every year for [inflation](/inflation).

The federal poverty level (FPL) is utilized to lay out who fits the bill for certain [federal subsidies](/subsidy) and aid, for example, Medicaid, Food Stamps (SNAP), Family and Planning Services, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the National School Lunch Program.

### Current Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

The FPL changes as indicated by the size of the family and their geographical location inside the country. For example, Alaska and Hawaii have higher poverty levels since the [cost of living](/cost-of-living) in these regions is higher.

A higher threshold is added to the poverty level for each extra family member, set at:

- **Bordering United States:** $4,540 per family member for 2021 ($4,720 for 2022)
- **Alaska:** $5,680 for 2021 ($5,900 for 2022)
- **Hawaii:** $5,220 for 2021 ($5,430 for 2022

Hence, since the federal poverty level (FPL) for a family of two is $18,310 in 2022, a family of three would have a poverty level set at $18,310 + $4,720 = $23,030 (in any state other than Hawaii or Alaska).

The table below shows the federal poverty guidelines for household sizes by region for 2021:

## The Federal Poverty Level versus the Poverty Threshold

Note that the federal poverty level (FPL) is different from the poverty threshold. The poverty threshold is another important federal poverty measure that really characterizes what poverty is and gives statistics on the number of Americans living in such conditions.

Data on the poverty threshold is made by the US Census Bureau, which utilizes pre-tax income as a measuring stick to measure poverty. The statistical report on the poverty threshold is then utilized by the HHS to decide the federal poverty level (FPL).

## The Federal Poverty Level Requirements for Welfare Programs

How a family's income compares to the federal poverty level (FPL) decides whether they are eligible for any plans. While deciding an individual's or a family's qualification for getting benefits, some government agencies compare [before-tax income](/grossincome) to the poverty guidelines, while others compare [after-tax income](/aftertaxincome).

Certain federal agencies and programs use percentage multiples of the federal poverty level (FPL) to characterize income limits and to set qualification criteria for households. For instance, an income of under 138% of the FPL will qualify an individual for [Medicaid](/medicaid) or [CHIP](/childrens-health care coverage program-chip). This means that an individual in a one-household setup in, say, Texas should earn below 138% x $13,590 = $18,754.20 in 2022 to be eligible for Medicaid.

The Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), Utility Assistance, and United Way Rent, then again, require a household to earn an income of under 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL). In the mean time, to be eligible for [premium tax credits](/advanced-premium-tax-credit) on [health insurance marketplace](/health care coverage marketplace) plans, which would assist with decreasing the regularly scheduled payments for a wellbeing plan, the criteria are in the scope of 100% to 400% of FPL.

> Increased premium tax credits in view of the lower-income contribution percentage alongside growing tax credit access to consumers with household incomes above 400%, were made accessible through HealthCare.gov starting on April 1, 2021.
>

To ascertain the percentage of poverty level, partition income by the poverty guideline and increase by 100. Thus, a family of five in New Jersey with an annual income of $80,000 would be calculated to earn ($80,000/$32,470) x 100 = 246% of the federal poverty guidelines for 2022, and will probably not fit the bill for Utility Assistance or Medicaid, yet may in any case be eligible for a [advanced premium tax credit](/advanced-premium-tax-credit) subsidy.

## Features
- The FPL is utilized to decide qualification for certain federal and state assistance programs, like housing vouchers, Medicaid, and CHIP.
- While the U.S. Census Bureau registers the poverty threshold, the Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) distributes the FPL.
- The federal poverty level (FPL), otherwise called the "poverty line," is the amount of annualized income earned by a household, below which they would be eligible to receive certain welfare benefits.
