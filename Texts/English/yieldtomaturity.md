# Yield to Maturity (YTM)
Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return of anticipated return on a bond in light of the term. Another well known bond measurement is current yield.

## Features
- Working out the yield to maturity can be a muddled interaction, and it expects all coupon or interest, payments can be reinvested at a similar rate of return as the bond.
- YTM is basically a bond's internal rate of return (IRR) whenever held to maturity.
- Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total rate of return that will have been earned by a bond when it makes all interest payments and reimburses the original principal.
## FAQ
### Is It Better to Have a Higher YTM?
Whether a higher YTM is positive relies upon the specific conditions. From one perspective, a higher YTM could demonstrate that a bargain opportunity is accessible since the bond being referred to is accessible for not exactly its par value. Yet, the key inquiry is whether this discount is justified by fundamentals, for example, the creditworthiness of the company giving the bond, or the interest rates introduced by alternative investments. As is much of the time the case in investing, further due diligence would be required.
### What Is a Bond's Yield to Maturity (YTM)?
The YTM of a bond is basically the [internal rate of return](/irr) (IRR) associated with buying that bond and holding it until its maturity date. At the end of the day, it is the return on investment associated with buying the bond and reinvesting its coupon payments at a steady interest rate. All else being equivalent, the YTM of a bond will be higher in the event that the price paid for the bond is lower, as well as the other way around.
### What Is the Difference Between a Bond's YTM and Its Coupon Rate?
The fundamental difference between the YTM of a bond and its coupon rate is that the coupon rate is fixed while the YTM vacillates over the long haul. The coupon rate is legally fixed, while the YTM changes in view of the price paid for the bond as well as the interest rates accessible somewhere else in the marketplace. Assuming the YTM is higher than the coupon rate, this proposes that the bond is being sold at a discount to its par value. On the off chance that, then again, the YTM is lower than the coupon rate, then the bond is being sold at a premium.
