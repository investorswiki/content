# High Beta Index
## What Is a High Beta Index?

A high beta index is a basket of stocks that exhibits greater volatility than a wide market index like the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 High Beta Index is the most notable of these indexes. It tracks the performance of 100 companies in the S&P 500 that are the most sensitive to changes in market returns.

[Beta](/beta) is the amount of volatility or systematic risk an asset exhibits compared to the market as a whole. Other than the leader enormous cap index, [Standard and Poor's](/sp) offers a number of high beta varieties for small-cap, mid-cap and other market indexes.

## High Beta Index Explained

High beta index companies display greater sensitivity than the more extensive market. Sensitivity is estimated by the beta of an individual stock. A beta of 1 demonstrates the asset moves in accordance with the market. Anything short of 1 addresses an asset less unpredictable than the market, while greater than 1 recommends a more unstable asset.

For instance, a beta of 1.2 means the asset is 20% more unpredictable than the market. On the other hand, a beta of 0.70 is hypothetically 30% less unpredictable than the market. Beta is estimated against a widely followed index like the [S&P 500 Index](/sp500).

Acquiring exposure to a high beta index requires an investment vehicle, for example, a [exchange traded fund](/etf) (ETF). The Invesco S&P 500 High Beta ETF (SPHB) is a widely traded asset that tracks unstable assets in the more extensive market. The ETF has failed to meet expectations the underlying S&P 500 Index since its commencement. Financial companies comprise almost 30% of the fund's assets, with Discover Financial Services (DFS), Lincoln National Corp (LNC) and Invesco (IVZ) among its biggest holdings.

## Limitations of a High Beta Index

As opposed to prevalent thinking, high beta or volatility doesn't be guaranteed to convert into greater returns. For a long time, the High Beta S&P 500 Index has failed to meet expectations its underlying benchmark. This happened during a period of resolute improvement in the more extensive market.

All things being equal, research shows that low volatility stocks will generally earn greater risk-adjusted returns than high volatility stocks. The explanation low beta will in general outperform can be credited to investment [behavioral biases](/behavioralfinance), like the representative heuristic and presumptuousness. Likewise, sector selection and other fundamental criteria play an important job in the volatility and performance of a high beta index.
