A trade price response would be the setting up of a trade in light of what the price does once it comes to the $25 level once more.

Once more on the off chance that the price moves close to $25, and begins to drop, a [short position](/short) might be initiated, since the initial evidence recommends that the resistance is holding.

Then again, assuming the price moves over the $25 level, a trader might enter a [long position](/long) in anticipation that the price will head higher in the wake of breaking through this critical level of resistance.

Trade price response can likewise be utilized to close trades. A trader might be holding a long position, yet on the off chance that the price moves below a support level, they close the position. Assuming that the support level holds, or the price ascends off support, the long position is held.
