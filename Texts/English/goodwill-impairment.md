# Goodwill Impairment
## What Is a Goodwill Impairment?

Goodwill impairment is an accounting charge that companies record when goodwill's [carrying value](/carryingvalue) on financial statements surpasses its fair value. In accounting, [goodwill](/goodwill) is recorded after a company gains [assets](/asset) and [liabilities](/responsibility), and pays a price in excess of their identifiable net value.

Goodwill impairment emerges when there is decay in the capacities of acquired assets to create [cash flows](/cashflow), and the fair value of the goodwill dips below its book value. Maybe the most popular goodwill impairment charge was the $54.2 billion reported in 2002 for the AOL Time Warner, Inc. merger. This was, at that point, the biggest goodwill impairment loss at any point reported by a company.

## How Goodwill Impairment Works

Goodwill [impairment](/impairment) is an earnings charge that companies record on their [income statements](/incomestatement) after they distinguish that there is powerful evidence that the asset associated with the goodwill can never again exhibit financial outcomes that were expected from it at the hour of its purchase.

Goodwill is a [intangible asset](/intangibleasset) regularly associated with the purchase of one company by another. In particular, goodwill is recorded in a situation in which the purchase price is higher than the net of the fair value of all identifiable [tangible](/tangibleasset) and elusive assets and liabilities assumed during the time spent a [acquisition](/acquisition). The value of a company's brand name, strong customer base, great customer relations, great employee relations, and any [patents](/patent) or [proprietary](/proprietarytechnology) technology address a few instances of goodwill.

Since many companies obtain different firms and pay a price that surpasses the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities that the acquired firm has, the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of acquired assets is recorded as goodwill. Notwithstanding, assuming that unexpected conditions emerge that reduction expected cash flows from acquired assets, the goodwill recorded can have a current fair value that is lower than what was initially booked, and the company must record a goodwill impairment.

## Special Considerations
### Changes in Accounting Standards for Goodwill

Goodwill impairment turned into an issue during the accounting embarrassments of 2000-2001. Many firms falsely expanded their balance sheets by reporting excessive values of goodwill, which was permitted around then to be [amortized](/amortization) over its estimated helpful life. [Amortizing an elusive asset](/amortization-of-intangibles) over its helpful life diminishes the amount of expense booked connected with that asset in any single year.

While [bull markets](/bullmarket) recently ignored goodwill and comparable controls, the accounting outrages and change in rules forced companies to report goodwill at reasonable levels. Current [accounting standards](/accounting-standard) require public companies to perform annual tests on goodwill impairment, and goodwill is not generally amortized.

### Annual Test for Goodwill Impairment

U.S. [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) expect companies to survey their goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level. Occasions that might trigger goodwill impairment remember weakening for economic conditions, increased competition, loss of key faculty, and regulatory action. The definition of a reporting unit assumes a vital part during the test; it is defined as the business unit that a company's management surveys and assesses as a separate segment. Reporting units regularly address distinct business lines, geographic units, or auxiliaries.

The fundamental technique overseeing goodwill impairment tests is set out by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) in "Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles â€” Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."

## Features
- Goodwill is an immaterial asset that accounts for the excess purchase price of one more company based on its proprietary or intellectual property, brand recognition, licenses, and so on, which isn't effectively quantifiable.
- Goodwill impairment is an accounting charge that is incurred when the fair value of goodwill dips under the recently recorded value from the hour of an acquisition.
- A test for goodwill impairment lined up with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must be embraced, at least, on an annual basis.
- Impairment might happen assuming the assets acquired never again produce the financial outcomes that were recently expected of them at the hour of purchase.
