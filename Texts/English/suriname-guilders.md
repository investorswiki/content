# Suriname Guilder (SRG)
## What Is the Suriname Guilder (SRG)?

The Suriname guilder was the official currency of the South American nation of Suriname until 2004, when it was supplanted by the [Suriname dollar](/srd-suriname-dollar) (SRD). Through this transfer, each recently issued Surinamese dollar supplanted 1,000 SRGs.

## Figuring out the SRG

Note that the penny coins addressing parts of one guilder stay being used, with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 1 SRD, and 2.50 SRD. As opposed to alluding to parts of a SRG, notwithstanding, these coins presently address a similar part of one SRD.

Surinamese guilders were named after the Dutch guilder, which was the currency of the Netherlands for just about 500 years prior to being supplanted by the [euro](/euro) (EUR) in 2002. A former Dutch province, Suriname is situated on the northern shore of South America. It is lined by Brazil in the south, with Guyana in the west and French Guiana in the east.

The Surinamese dollar was first presented in January 2004 as Suriname's official currency, supplanting the guilder at a rate of 1,000:1. Old coins in light of the former currency remained in circulation with the new dollar bills, to a great extent for convenience and cost savings.

As an economically non-industrial country, Suriname's economy depends vigorously on natural resources like gold, bauxite, and oil, and it very well may be sensitive to changes in world commodity prices. The guilder itself experienced high [inflation](/inflation) in the mid 1990s, which was part of the reasoning for the country's decision to supplant it with the Surinamese dollar. Tragically, the SRD has as of late likewise been held with serious inflation.
