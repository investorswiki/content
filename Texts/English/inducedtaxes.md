# Induced Taxes
## What Are Induced Taxes?

Induced taxes are taxes applied as a fraction, rate, or percentage of income, spending, or profits to such an extent that a rise in income, spending, or profits prompts an increase in the amount of the tax in some extent. In [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics), induced taxes function as [automatic stabilizers](/automaticstabilizer), which moderate aggregate demand during extensions and lift aggregate demand during contractions and recessions.

## Understanding Induced Taxes

In Keynesian macroeconomic theory, lacks in [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand) can lead to economic [recessions](/recession), and a primary goal of government economic policy is to fight these recessions and all the more generally to streamline economic high points and low points. One famous tool to approach this is the utilization of automatic stabilizers.

Automatic stabilizers are standing laws, taxes, or other policy measures that lift aggregate demand during slow economic times and rein in aggregate demand during periods when economic growth accelerates too fast, and require no new laws or changes to policies to function. Induced taxes are a common form of automatic stabilizers.

Induced taxes incorporate [proportional](/proportionaltax) or [progressive](/progressivetax) taxes on personal incomes, expenditures, or business profits. Since these taxes rise (or fall) alongside the underlying activity being taxed, they moderate the effect that changes in economic activity have on aggregate demand. In Keynesian terms, they reduce the [multiplier effect](/multipliereffect) that changes in spending or income have on gross domestic product (GDP).

## Illustration of Induced Taxes

For instance, a [income tax](/incometax) of 10% makes induced taxes when income rises, equivalent to 10% of the increase in income. Income earners keep the other 90% of the extra income they earn, to spend or invest, and this, thus, can help aggregate demand by 90% of the expansion to income.

Without the 10% tax, income earners would have all of that increase in income to spend — or invest. By decreasing the effect that the rise in income has on individuals' ability to spend and invest more, the induced tax reduces the impact that the rise in income can have in helping aggregate demand and subsequently economic growth. In Keynesian theory, this can assist with staying away from a [overheated economy](/overheated_economy) and speeding up [inflation](/inflation).

Then again, if an economic downturn or negative [economic shock](/economic-shock) hits and income falls, then, at that point, with the 10% income tax the total amount of income taxes being paid likewise falls. After-tax incomes just fall by 90% of the reduction in income, in light of the fact that the other 10% addresses induced taxes that the income earners never again owe. In Keynesian theory, this will quite often moderate the negative impact that a fall in incomes has on aggregate demand and [GDP](/gdp), mellowing the blow of a recession.

## Types of Induced Taxes

Deals taxes, value-added taxes, taxes on investment, and taxes on business incomes and profits comparatively affect changes in [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) and business investment. Taxes with progressive [tax brackets](/taxbracket) can have an even more impressive stabilizing effect, particularly on large changes in income or spending.

Since induced taxes reduce the swings in aggregate demand and GDP on both the upside and the downside of [economic cycles](/economic-cycle), in theory, they — alongside other automatic stabilizers like unemployment protection — ought to reduce the overall volatility of [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) performance.
