# Point-and-Figure (P&F) Chart
## What Is a Point-and-Figure (P&F) Chart?

A point-and-figure chart plots price movements for stocks, bonds, commodities, or [futures](/futures) without thinking about the progression of time.

In spite of a few different types of charts, similar to candlesticks, which mark the degree of an asset's movement throughout set time spans, P&F charts use columns comprising of stacked X's or alternately O's, every one of which addresses a set amount of price movement. The X's show rising prices, while O's address a falling price.

Technical analysts actually use concepts like support and resistance, as well as different examples, while review P&F charts. A few contend that support and resistance levels, as well as [breakouts](/breakout), are all the more plainly defined on a P&F chart since it sift through little price movements and is less helpless to [false breakouts](/failedbreak).

## Instructions to Calculate Point-and-Figure (P&F) Charts

Point-and-figure charts don't need calculation, however they really do expect somewhere around two variables to be set.

One variable is the container size. The container size can be a specific dollar amount, for example, $1, a percentage, for example, 3% of the current price, or it very well may be founded on [average true range](/atr) (ATR) and that means the crate size will change in view of volatility.

The reversal amount likewise should be set. The reversal amount is regularly three times the container size. For instance, assuming that the crate size is $1, the reversal amount is $3. The reversal can be set at anything the trader wants, for example, one times the container size, or 5.5 times the case size.

A discretionary variable is whether to involve high and low prices for the underlying asset or to utilize [closing prices](/closingprice). Utilizing high and low prices will mean the creation of more X's and O's, while utilizing just closing prices (less movement being calculated compared to high and lows) will mean less X's and O's are made.

## What Does a Point-and-Figure (P&F) Chart Tell You?

Point-and-figure charts frequently give [technical analysts](/technicalanalysis) with various trade and trend signals, relative to traditional candlestick or bar charts. While certain analysts depend all the more vigorously on the point-and-figure charts, others utilize these charts to confirm signals given by traditional charts with an end goal to stay away from false breakouts.

The key to point-and-figure charting is the case size, or the amount of price movement that decides if another X or O is added to the chart. For instance, say the container size is $3. On the off chance that the last X occurred at a price of $15, another one is added to the current column of X's the point at which the price rises to $18.

Eminently, the line of X's go on in a similar column, given that the price proceeds to rise and doesn't breach a foreordained reversal amount, at which point, another column of O's starts.

The equivalent is true for a column of O's in a [declining market](/bearmarket); the column go on until the stock arrives at the reversal amount, at which point another column of X's starts.

A reversal happens when the price is done sufficiently moving to put one more X or O in the current X or O column, and then, at that point, the price moves something like three box sizes (assuming that this is the picked reversal amount) the other way. At the point when a reversal happens, several X's or alternately O's will be drawn simultaneously. For instance, following a price rise or column of X's, on the off chance that a reversal happens and the reversal amount is three box sizes, when the reversal happens three O's will be drawn starting one spot below the highest X.

Traders use P&F charts in comparable ways to different charts. Traders actually watch for support and resistance levels. Breakouts can signal major trend changes. Contingent upon the case size, the actual columns can address huge trends, and when the column changes (from O to X, or X to O) that might signal a critical trend reversal or [pullback](/pullback).

## Point-and-Figure Analysts

Charles Dow, the organizer behind **The Wall Street Journal,** is credited with creating point-and-figure charting as a method for deciding lopsided characteristics among [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand).

One of the principal technical analysts work in point-and-figure charting is Tom Dorsey, who established the research firm Dorsey, Wright and Associates in 1987. He composed several books on the point, including **Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices.** Nasdaq purchased Dorsey, Wright and Associates in 2015.

Dorsey assisted with advocating the utilization of point-and-figure charts with additional traditional technical indicators, for example, [moving averages](/movingaverage), relative strength, and [advance/decline lines](/advancedeclineline).

## The Difference Between Point-and-Figure (P&F) and Renko Charts

[Renko Charts](/renkochart) are likewise founded on box size, and when the price moves by the crate size it makes an up or down block that moves at a 45-degree point to the prior block. Renko charts never have blocks next to one another. Subsequently, a reversal happens on the off chance that the price moves the other way by two box amounts.

The primary difference between the chart types is the look. P&F charts are side-by-side columns of X's and O's, while a renko chart is made by a series of boxes spread out over the long run at 45-degree angles.

## Limitations of Using Point-and-Figure (P&F) Charts

P&F charts can be slow to respond to price changes. A breakout, for instance, must move the case amount to signal a breakout happened. This might benefit a few traders as it might reduce false breakout signals, however the price has previously moved the crate amount (or more) past the breakout point. For certain traders, getting the signal after the price has proactively moved that much may not be effective.

Likewise, while P&F charts might assist with lessening the number of false breakouts, false breakouts actually happen. What gives off an impression of being a breakout might in any case be switched a short time later.

P&F charts are great at keeping traders in strong trends, as a ton of small counter-trend movements are sifted through. Yet when a reversal happens it can fundamentally delete profits or result in big losses. Since the reversal amount is normally so large, in the event that a trader is just utilizing P&F charts they won't see the reversal until the price has moved essentially against them.

While utilizing P&F charts, it is prescribed to likewise watch the genuine price of the asset so that risk can be observed in real time. This should be possible by monitoring a candlestick or [open-high-low-close](/ohlcchart) (OHLC) chart.

## Highlights
- X's and O's stack on top of one another, separately, and will frequently form a series of X's or alternately O's.
- A X is made when the price moves higher by a set amount, called the case size. An O is made when the price drops the case size amount.
- The container size is set in view of the asset's price and the financial backer's preference.
- The formation of another column of X's or alternately O's happens when the price moves in opposition to its current trend, and does as such by more than the reversal amount.
