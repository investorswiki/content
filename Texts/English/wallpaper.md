## What Is Wallpaper?

Wallpaper is the name given to stocks, bonds, and different securities that have become worthless. This colloquialism saw its starting points when stocks and bonds existed as printed, physical certificates instead of digital recognizing data stored on a [brokerage](/brokerage-company's) server.

The name stuck, in any case, and means when a stock or bond certificate (or one more exercisable right to securities, for example, stock [options](/choice)) no longer has value due to different reasons, most commonly, bankruptcy.

## Figuring out Wallpaper

This was a genuine practice during the [Great Depression](/great_depression) that followed the [Stock Market Crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929). In that period, physical paper certificates addressed real ownership of shares of a company.

At the point when the stock market crashed on Black Thursday (Oct. 25, 1929), $30 billion was immediately lost. That amount was two times the U.S. national debt at that point. Exactly 20,000 companies failed, which left numerous investors with a great deal of worthless paper.

Those fortunate enough to stay away from vagrancy utilized the now-worthless stock certificates to paper their walls, an old technique used to plug drafts before protection was widely accessible or utilized. Others might have cynically stuck the worthless certificates to their walls as decoration.

Presently, wallpaper is utilized to portray any security that has lost all value, even assuming that there could be as of now not a functional use for it.
