## What Is Lean Six Sigma?

Lean Six Sigma is a group centered managerial approach that looks to further develop performance by dispensing with waste and imperfections. It consolidates [Six Sigma](/six-sigma) methods and devices and the lean manufacturing/[lean enterprise](/lean-enterprise) philosophy, endeavoring to wipe out misuse of physical resources, time, exertion and ability while guaranteeing quality in production and organizational processes. Basically, under the fundamentals of Lean Six Sigma any utilization of resources that doesn't make [value](/value) for the end customer is viewed as a waste and ought to be wiped out.

## Figuring out Lean Six Sigma

Lean Six Sigma can see its starting points in the United States during the 1980s as a combination of management principles and processes that originated in Japan. With an end goal to rival Japan's better products, U.S. managers adopted some Japanese manufacturing principles that zeroed in on lessening waste as non-value-adding activities. During the 1990s, such principles were adopted by large U.S. manufacturers. Lean Six Sigma was presented by Michael George and Robert Lawrence Jr. in their 2002 book **Lean Six Sigma: Combining Six Sigma with Lean Speed** as a combination and refinement of lean enterprise and Six Sigma principles.

## Lean Six Sigma Tenets

The "lean" concept of management loans its attention on the reduction and elimination of eight sorts of waste known as "DOWNTIME," which is a truncation of deformities, overproduction, waiting, non-used ability, transportation, inventory, movement, and extra-handling. "Lean" alludes to a method, measure or device that aides in the identification and elimination of waste.

The term Six Sigma alludes to instruments and methods that are utilized to improve [manufacturing](/manufacturing) processes. It was presented by an engineer at Motorola in 1986 and propelled by Japan's [Kaizen](/kaizen) model. It was reserved by the company in 1993. Its intent is to further develop processes by distinguishing and disposing of the reasons for imperfections and variations in business and manufacturing processes. Six Sigma's DMAIC phases are used in Lean Six Sigma. The abbreviation represents characterize, measure, investigate, improve and control and alludes to an information driven method for improving, streamlining and stabilizing business and manufacturing processes.

The combination of lean management concepts and Six Sigma's instruments and strategies clarifies what processes are inclined to variation and afterward decreases those variations as a method for guaranteeing proceeded with improvement.

## Lean Six Sigma Levels

Lean Six Sigma training utilizes "Belt" levels to signify ability like Six Sigma.

- Yellow Belt: Awareness of Lean Six Sigma
- Green Belt: An emphasis on the utilization of devices and the application of DMAIC and lean principles
- Black Belt: Full-time project pioneer
- Master Black Belt: A Black Belt with at least two years of experience. Able to show Lean Six Sigma.
