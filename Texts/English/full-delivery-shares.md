## Illustration of Full Delivery Shares

In November 2016, after two lethal accidents in no less than seven months of one another, TransAsia Airways was downgraded to full delivery stock. TransAsis was the principal listed company on Taiwan's primary stock exchange to close down in the midst of unreasonable heavy losses. The Taiwan Stock Exchange justified assigning TransAsia's shares as a full delivery stock in light of the fact that the closure of a listed company was probably going to unfavorably affect shareholder equity and could impact the exchange's weighted index.

On account of TransAsia, shares fell 7.14% on November 21, 2016, and trading of the stock was suspended for one day while investors sat tight for a decision on the company's destiny. After TransAsia announced, it would quickly cease operations and break up the shares were set into full delivery share category while trading continued the next day. As a full delivery stock, TransAsia shares kept on plunging by the maximum daily decline of 10%. In the wake of experiencing further losses, TransAsia was delisted from the market after it held a special meeting for shareholders on January 11, 2017.
