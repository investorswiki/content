# Mortgage Bond
## What is a Mortgage Bond?

A mortgage bond is secured by a mortgage, or a pool of mortgages, that are normally backed by real estate holdings and [real property](/real-property), like equipment.

## Understanding Mortgage Bonds

Mortgage bonds offer the investor protection on the grounds that the [principal](/principal) is secured by a significant asset. In the event of default, mortgage [bondholders](/bondholder) could sell off the underlying property to make up for the default and secure payment of dividends. In any case, due to this inherent safety, the average mortgage bond will in general yield a lower [rate of return](/rateofreturn) than traditional [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) that are backed exclusively by the corporation's commitment and ability to pay.

At the point when a person purchases a home and finances the purchase with a mortgage, the lender rarely holds ownership of the mortgage. All things being equal, it sells the mortgage on the secondary market to another entity, for example, an investment bank or [government-sponsored enterprise](/gse) (GSE). This entity bundles the mortgage with a pool of different loans and issues bonds with the mortgages as backing.

At the point when homeowners pay their mortgages, the interest portion of their payment is utilized to pay the yield on these mortgage bonds. However long the greater part of the homeowners in the mortgage pool keep up with their payments, a mortgage bond is a safe and dependable pay delivering security.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Mortgage Bonds

A disadvantage of mortgage bonds is that their yields will generally be lower than corporate bond yields on the grounds that the [securitization](/securitization) of mortgages makes such bonds safer investments. That's what an advantage would in the event that a homeowner defaults on a mortgage, the bondholders have a claim on the value of the homeowner's property. The property can be liquidated with the proceeds used to repay bondholders. One more advantage of mortgage bonds is that they are a safer investment than stocks, for instance.

Conversely, investors in corporate bonds have almost no recourse in the event that the corporation can't pay. Subsequently, when corporations issue bonds, they must offer higher yields to captivate investors to bear the risk of unsecured debt.

## Special Considerations for Mortgage Bonds

One major exception to the common guideline that mortgage bonds address a safe investment became obvious during the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) of the late 2000s. Leading up to this period, investors realized they could earn higher yields purchasing bonds backed by [subprime mortgages](/subprime-implosion) — mortgages offered to purchasers with poor credit or mysterious pay — while as yet partaking in the alleged security of investing in collateralized debt.

Tragically, enough of these subprime mortgages defaulted to cause a crisis during which many mortgage bonds defaulted costing investors a huge number of dollars. Since the crisis, there has been increased examination over such securities. By the by, the Fed actually holds a sizable amount of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS, for example, mortgage bonds. As of Feb. 2021, the Fed held around $2.1 trillion in MBS, as per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
