# Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR)
## What Is the Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR)?

## Grasping the Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR)

The DIR is viewed as by some market analysts to be a more valuable liquidity ratio than the standard [quick ratio](/quickratio) or [current ratio](/currentratio) due to the way that it compares assets to expenses as opposed to contrasting assets with liabilities. The DIR is regularly utilized as a strengthening financial analysis ratio, along with the current or quick ratio, to assess a company's financial wellbeing, since there can be substantially unique DIR and quick or current ratio values if, for instance, a company has a large number of expenses yet practically no debt.
