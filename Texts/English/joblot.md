# Job Lot
## What Is a Job Lot?

In finance, the term "job parcel" alludes to a [commodities futures contract](/futurescontract) whose denomination is smaller than the normal standard part for that commodity. For instance, the standard part for a [crude oil](/crude-oil) futures contract is 1,000 barrels for every contract. Any crude oil futures contract relating to under 1,000 barrels would subsequently be viewed as a job part.

The term job part is likewise utilized in the manufacturing sector, to allude to custom jobs whose boundaries fall outside of the normal production process.

## How Job Lots Work

The present commodity futures exchanges are a large and important part of the global financial markets. Through them, producers can access the fundamental commodities they need, while financial buyers can [speculate](/hypothesis) on commodity prices and control risks through [hedging](/fence) activities. One of the key parts of this system is the way that commodity exchanges utilize standard contracts. This enormously works on the trading system and permits transactions to occur in large volumes and at high rates.

Oftentimes, be that as it may, the standard contract sizes for commodity futures could be restrictively large for smaller companies and investors. For example, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](/cme's) futures contract for soybeans relates to about 136 metric lots of soybeans per contract. A generally small buyer who plans to take physical endless supply of the contract probably won't require that quantity of supply. Essentially, a speculator with generally limited capital to invest may be hesitant to theorize on soybean futures on the off chance that they risk being forced to take delivery of such a large volume of soybeans possibly.

To assist with obliging these smaller market participants, commodities exchanges sometimes permit smaller order sizes. These 'job part' futures contracts permit smaller denominations, for example, 100 barrels of oil as compared to the standard 1,000. By permitting smaller investors to participate in the futures market, job parcels assist with expanding the total [liquidity](/liquidity) of the marketplace, making it simpler for all traders to benefit from fast transaction times and moderately efficient prices.

## Real World Example of a Job Lot

Futures contracts are regularly standardized and trade on a futures exchange. A futures contract is viewed as a job part when the agreement between the buyer and seller for the delivery of a commodity has a quantity below the normal limits for a commodity futures contract.

For instance, precious metals — like gold and silver — are frequently bought and sold as commodities futures contracts. A commodities exchange could issue silver futures contracts designated in 5-ounce increases. On the off chance that the exchange agreed to go into a commodity futures contract with a buyer below the 5-ounce least, it would be viewed as a job parcel.
