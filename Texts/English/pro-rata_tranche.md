# Pro-Rata Tranche
## What Is a Pro-Rata Tranche?

A pro-rata tranche is a portion of a syndicated loan that is involved two highlights: a [revolving credit](/revolvingcredit) facility, and a [amortizing term loan](/amortized_loan). Pro-rata tranches are common inside the leveraged loan market or in loans to companies with existing high debt loads.

Inside the [pro-rata](/pro-rata) tranche, the revolving credit line will commonly have a similar ending or [maturity date](/maturitydate) as the term loan. Pro-rata tranches have generally been a lot larger than institutional tranches in terms of their dollar size.

## Grasping a Pro-Rata Tranche
### Syndicated Loans

A [syndicated loan](/syndicatedloan), otherwise called a syndicated bank [facility](/facility), is financing offered by a group of lenders — alluded to as a [syndicate](/syndicate) — who cooperate to provide funds for a single borrower. The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government.

The loan can include a fixed amount of funds, a credit line, or a combination of both. Syndicated loans emerge when a project requires too large a loan for a single lender or when a project needs a particular lender with mastery in a specific asset class.

### The Leveraged Loan

A [leveraged loan](/leveragedloan) is a type of loan that is extended to companies or people that as of now have impressive amounts of [debt](/debt) or a poor [credit history](/credit-history). Lenders consider leveraged loans to carry a higher risk of [default](/default2), thus a leveraged loan is more exorbitant to the borrower.

Default happens when a borrower can't make any payments for an extended period. Leveraged loans for companies or people with high levels of debt will generally have higher interest rates than run of the mill loans; the increased interest mirrors the greater level of risk implied in giving the loans.

Most leveraged loans are structured and syndicated to oblige two primary types of lenders: banks (domestic and foreign) and institutional investment companies. Thus, leveraged loans comprise of pro-rata debt (the pro-rata tranche), and institutional debt.

Investors in pro-rata loans are fundamentally banks and other financing companies. Loans in the pro-rata tranche permit borrowers to draw down funds, repay them, then draw down once more. Investments in institutional loans — which, generally, are [term loans](/termloan) — incorporate structured finance products, [collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)](/clo), and mutual funds, among other investment vehicles.

## Qualities of the Pro-Rata Tranche

In business and finance, **pro rata** makes an interpretation of from Latin to mean "in proportion." In this unique situation, pro rata alludes to a process where whatever is being allocated will be distributed in equivalent portions. So the pro-rata tranche circulates the debt among a number of banks proportionately, in this way enormously lessening every lender's likely loss or [credit risk](/creditrisk). This is viewed as being ideal toward the syndication of lending institutions.

The pro-rata tranche is generally involved [working-capital](/workingcapital) lenders that hold a pro-rata share of the revolving credit facility and the more limited maturity amortizing term loan. When in doubt, these investors are actively participated in the business of lending, and the sizes (dollar amount) they hold in a particular loan are somewhat huge compared to those of their institutional counterparts.

## Inherent Risk of the Pro-Rata Tranche

Putting resources into leveraged loans has more inherent [risk](/risk) than numerous different investments, including [equities](/value). Due to this risk potential, the pro-rata tranche is portrayed by an involved approach, which frequently subjects the borrower to more tight monitoring and oversight.

An economy that is encountering a [contraction](/contraction) in its institutional markets would will generally have a fairly [risk-averse](/riskaverse) lending mentality. So investors in this economy — particularly in the [middle market](/middle-market) — could feel more OK with a more modest, more active lending group, rather than the widely syndicated, large institutional-financial backer driven leveraged loan market of the 1990s, for instance.
