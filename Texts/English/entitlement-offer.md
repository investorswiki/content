# Entitlement Offer
## What Is an Entitlement Offer?

An entitlement offer is an offer to purchase a security or other asset that can't be transferred to another party. An entitlement offer is offered at a specific price and must be utilized during a set time period. Neglecting to utilize the entitlement offer will lead to its withdrawal. An entitlement offer is otherwise called a [open offer](/openoffer) or a non-transferable offer.

## How an Entitlement Offer Works

Entitlement offers are generally regularly associated with the issuance of new shares of stock by a company. A company hoping to raise new capital can offer existing shareholders an arrangement â€”, for example, the ability to purchase a given amount of new shares at a set price throughout a specific time span. Dissimilar to with a rights offer, the existing [shareholder](/shareholder) can't transfer the entitlement offer to any other person.

Restricting who can utilize the entitlement offer increases the intricacies associated with a transaction. From the onset, the company giving the offer might need to match the type of new shares the offer is furnishing with the type of shares the shareholder as of now has. In the event that the [investor](/investor) decides not to purchase the new shares the company likewise can't transfer the offer to another shareholder.

One option that the company has on account of a declined entitlement offer is to shift the sale of the new shares to the overall population, albeit this would mean that the price it would bring may not be equivalent to with the entitlement offer, and may as a matter of fact increase the cost of giving shares.

## Special Considerations

The entitlement offer's limited time period is typically adequately long to furnish the existing shareholder with sufficient opportunity to analyze whether the offer is in their best interest. At times, existing shareholders with large holdings are given a larger share of the new issues. To tempt larger or institutional shareholders, the responsible company might issue an accelerated entitlement offer, meaning that the amount of time that a shareholder needs to choose is decreased.
