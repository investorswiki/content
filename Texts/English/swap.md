# Swap
## What Is a Swap?

A swap is a [derivative](/derivative) contract through which two gatherings exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two unique financial instruments. Most swaps include cash flows in light of a [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) like a loan or bond, albeit the instrument can be nearly anything. Typically, the principal doesn't change hands. Each [cash flow](/cashflow) comprises one [leg](/leg) of the swap. One cash flow is generally fixed, while the other is variable and in view of a benchmark interest rate, [floating currency exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate), or index price.

The most common sort of swap is a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap). Swaps don't trade on exchanges, and retail investors don't generally participate in swaps. Rather, swaps are [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) contracts essentially between organizations or financial institutions that are tweaked to the necessities of the two players.

## Swaps Explained
### Interest Rate Swaps

In an interest rate swap, the gatherings exchange cash flows in view of a notional principal amount (this amount isn't actually exchanged) to [hedge](/hedge) against [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) or to [speculate](/hypothesis). For instance, envision ABC Co. has just issued $1 million out of five-year bonds with a variable annual interest rate defined as the [London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)](/libor) plus 1.3% (or 130 basis points). Additionally, accept that LIBOR is at 2.5% and ABC management is restless about an interest rate rise.

The management team tracks down another company, XYZ Inc., that will pay ABC an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.3% on a notional principal of $1 million for quite some time. In other words, XYZ will fund ABC's interest payments on its most recent bond issue. In exchange, ABC pays XYZ a fixed annual rate of 5% on a notional value of $1 million for quite a long time. ABC benefits from the swap in the event that rates rise fundamentally over the next five years. XYZ benefits assuming rates fall, remain flat, or rise just steadily.

> According to an announcement by the Federal Reserve, banks ought to stop composing contracts utilizing LIBOR toward the finish of 2021. The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop distributing multi week and multi month LIBOR after December 31, 2021. All LIBOR contracts must be wrapped up by June 30, 2023.
>

Below are two scenarios for this interest rate swap: LIBOR rises 0.75% each year and LIBOR rises 0.25% each year.

### Scenario 1

Assuming LIBOR rises by 0.75% each year, Company ABC's total interest payments to its bondholders over the five-year period amount to $225,000. How about we break down the calculation:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> </td><td>Libor + 1.30%</td><td>Variable Interest Paid by XYZ to ABC</td><td>5% Interest Paid by ABC to XYZ</td><td>ABC's Gain</td><td>XYZ's Loss</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 1</td><td>3.80%</td><td>$38,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>-$12,000</td><td>$12,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 2</td><td>4.55%</td><td>$45,500</td><td>$50,000</td><td>-$4,500</td><td>$4,500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 3</td><td>5.30%</td><td>$53,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$3,000</td><td>-$3,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 4</td><td>6.05%</td><td>$60,500</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$10,500</td><td>-$10,500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 5</td><td>6.80%</td><td>$68,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$18,000</td><td>-$18,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>$15,000</td><td>($15,000)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this scenario, ABC did well on the grounds that its interest rate was fixed at 5% through the swap. ABC paid $15,000 short of what it would have with the variable rate. XYZ's forecast was incorrect, and the company lost $15,000 through the swap since rates increased quicker than it had expected.

### Scenario 2

In the second scenario, LIBOR rises by 0.25% each year:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> </td><td>Libor + 1.30%</td><td>Variable Interest Paid by XYZ to ABC</td><td>5% Interest Paid by ABC to XYZ</td><td>ABC's Gain</td><td>XYZ's Loss</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 1</td><td>3.80%</td><td>$38,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>($12,000)</td><td>$12,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 2</td><td>4.05%</td><td>$40,500</td><td>$50,000</td><td>($9,500)</td><td>$9,500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 3</td><td>4.30%</td><td>$43,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>($7,000)</td><td>$7,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 4</td><td>4.55%</td><td>$45,500</td><td>$50,000</td><td>($4,500)</td><td>$4,500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Year 5</td><td>4.80%</td><td>$48,000</td><td>$50,000</td><td>($2,000)</td><td>$2,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>($35,000)</td><td>$35,000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this case, ABC would have been better off by not taking part in the swap since interest rates increased gradually. XYZ benefitted $35,000 by taking part in the swap on the grounds that its forecast was correct.

This model doesn't account for the other benefits ABC could have received by taking part in the swap. For instance, maybe the company required another loan, however lenders were reluctant to do that except if the interest obligations on its other bonds were fixed.

As a rule, the two gatherings would act through a bank or other intermediary, which would take a cut of the swap. Whether it is advantageous for two elements to go into an interest rate swap relies upon their [comparative advantage](/comparativeadvantage) in fixed or [floating-rate](/floatinginterestrate) lending markets.

## Other Swaps

The instruments exchanged in a swap don't need to be interest payments. Countless assortments of exotic swap agreements exist, however moderately common arrangements incorporate commodity swaps, currency swaps, debt swaps, and total return swaps.

### Commodity Swaps

[Commodity swaps](/commodityswap) include the exchange of a floating commodity price, for example, the Brent Crude oil [spot price](/spotprice), at a set cost over a settled upon period. As this model recommends, commodity swaps most commonly include crude oil.

### Currency Swaps

In a [currency swap](/currencyswap), the gatherings exchange interest and principal payments on debt designated in various currencies. Dissimilar to an interest rate swap, the principal is certainly not a notional amount, however it is exchanged alongside interest obligations. Currency swaps can happen between countries. For instance, China has utilized swaps with Argentina, assisting the last option with settling its [foreign reserves](/global reserves). The [U.S. Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) participated in an aggressive swap strategy with European [central banks](/centralbank) during the 2010 European financial crisis to balance out the euro, which was falling in value due to the Greek debt crisis.

### Debt-Equity Swaps

A [debt-value swap](/debtequityswap) includes the exchange of debt for value — on account of a public corporation, this would mean bonds for stocks. It is a way for companies to refinance their debt or redistribute their [capital structure](/capitalstructure).

### Total Return Swaps

In a [total return swap](/totalreturnswap), the total return from an asset is exchanged for a fixed interest rate. This gives the party paying the fixed-rate exposure to the underlying asset — a stock or a [index](/marketindex). For instance, an investor could pay a fixed rate to one party in return for the capital appreciation plus [dividend](/dividend) payments of a pool of stocks.

### Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A [credit default swap (CDS)](/creditdefaultswap) consists of an agreement by one party to pay the lost principal and interest of a loan to the CDS buyer if a borrower [defaults](/default2) on a loan. Unnecessary [leverage](/leverage) and poor risk management in the CDS market were contributing reasons for the 2008 financial crisis.

## Swaps Summary

A financial swap is a derivative contract where one party exchanges or "swaps" the cash flows or value of one asset for another. For instance, a company paying a variable rate of interest might swap its interest payments with another company that will then pay the main company a fixed rate. Swaps can likewise be utilized to exchange other sorts of value or risk like the potential for a credit default in a bond.
