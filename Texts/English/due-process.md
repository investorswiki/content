## What Is Due Process?

Due process is a requirement that legal issues be settled by laid out rules and principles, and that individuals be dealt with fairly. Due process applies to both civil and criminal matters.

The document alluded to as a charter (**carta** means charter in middle age Latin), looked to address numerous economic and political complaints that barons had with the government.

In one of its clauses, the king guaranteed: "No free man will be seized or detained, or stripped of his rights or assets, or outlawed or banished, or denied of his standing in differently, nor will we continue with force against him, or send others to do as such, besides by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."

The king was in this way prevented from for arbitrary reasons changing or overlooking laws, with the Magna Carta laying out the rule of law that the government must follow.

Due process kept on being a part of British law for a really long time after the signing of the Magna Carta, yet the relationship among parliament and the courts [limited its application in practice](/limited-government). The courts didn't have the power of judicial audit, which would have permitted them to decide if government actions disregarded the rule of law, and consequently couldn't necessarily in every case enforce due process. Judges couldn't be as self-assured in guarding due process in the face of parliamentary action, with the contrary holding true in the United States.
