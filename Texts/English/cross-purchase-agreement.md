## What Is a Cross-Purchase Agreement?

A cross-purchase agreement is a document that permits a company's partners or other [shareholders](/shareholder) to purchase the interest or shares of a partner who kicks the bucket, becomes weakened or resigns. The mechanism frequently depends on a life insurance policy in the event of a death to work with that exchange of value. A cross-purchase agreement is generally utilized in business continuation planning, where the document frames how the shares can be partitioned or purchased by the excess partners, for example, a proportional distribution as per each partner's stake in the company.

Cross-purchase agreements are a specific type of [buy-sell agreement](/buy-and-sell-agreement).

## The Basics of a Cross-Purchase Agreement

A cross-purchase agreement is put in place if shares become suddenly accessible. As a contingency plan for a partner's death, a partner will probably take out term [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) policies on different partners and show himself as the [beneficiary](/beneficiary). Assuming one of the partners bites the dust, the funds from the life insurance policy can be utilized to buy the departed's interest.

Due to the structure of life insurance, this transfer of wealth won't be subject to income tax. As well as being tax-free, life insurance proceeds from a cross-purchase agreement are not subject to lenders' claims, in light of the fact that the owners of the business are the owners of the policies. Essentially, to prepare for conceivable weakening, a partner would purchase disability insurance.

The third major trigger for a cross-purchase agreement is the retirement of a partner, while additional far reaching agreements contain statements for the divorce of a partner (to figure out legal language for the ex-mate) or personal bankruptcy circumstances. Some cross-purchase agreements have a predetermined [buyout](/buyout) price, which should be refreshed intermittently, while others utilize a valuation formula or specify the hiring of an independent appraiser.

A solution for a problem of too many partners is solidifying an agreement under a single trustee, which would possess policies on each partner, collect proceeds when the opportunity arrives, and afterward disseminate the shares to enduring partners.
