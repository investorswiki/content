# European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)
## What Is the European Financial Stability Facility?

The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was made in 2010 as a brief crisis resolution measure in the wake of the financial and [sovereign debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) in the euro area (eurozone). It gave assistance to Ireland, Portugal, and Greece. It no longer gives new financial assistance, with this task the responsibility of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) starting around 2012, however it keeps on existing to satisfy obligations on recently agreed programs.

## Grasping the European Financial Stability Facility

The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was set up by the [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU) to assist with funding countries that couldn't fund themselves during the sovereign debt crisis. The EFSF offered financial assistance to euro area countries deprived in this specific situation, gave they committed to undertaking certain changes (pointed toward forestalling the repeat of comparable emergencies). This assistance was financed through the issuance of EFSF bonds and other capital market instruments. The EFSF was authorized to raise a maximum of \u20ac440 billion in the capital market through the issuance of these securities. The securities, thusly, are backed by guarantees from member countries in the eurozone, with respect to their shares of capital in the [European Central Bank](/europeancentralbank) (ECB). The total guarantee line is \u20ac780 billion. In a nutshell, the guarantees pulled in investors who were not able to loan straightforwardly to the crisis countries, and the EFSF gave loans to those countries (conditional upon the commitment to changes).

The EFSF has not offered any new financing since July 1, 2013, having been supplanted in this function by the ESM, which is a permanent crisis resolution mechanism. The EFSF, in any case, stays in presence to keep on financing agreed programs; its continuous activities incorporate getting loan repayments from the countries it has assisted; making principal and interest payments on its issued bonds to investors; and [rolling over](/rollover) existing bonds, in light of the fact that the maturity of its loans to the euro area beneficiaries is longer than that of its issued bonds.

Albeit the EFSF and ESM are various institutions with various governance structures, they share similar staff and offices (in Luxembourg). The two of them have a similar mission: to defend financial stability in Europe through financial assistance to euro area countries. The two mechanisms together have dispensed \u20ac250 billion. Notwithstanding [Portugal, Greece, and Ireland](/piigs), which were initially assisted by the EFSF, Spain and Cyprus have likewise received financing from the ESM. As of August 2018, these countries have changed and worked on effectively enough to have left their EFSF/ESM programs without requiring follow-up arrangements.
