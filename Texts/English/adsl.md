# Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
## What Is an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)?

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a technology that gives high transmission speeds to video and voice to homes over an ordinary copper telephone wire. It will be most financially savvy in areas with a low market penetration of cable TV.

## Understanding an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), now and again just called DSL, is viewed as the major competition to cable modems. DSL and cable systems are compared by [bandwidth](/bandwidth), a measure of how much data a network can transfer. Internet suppliers commonly mean bandwidth speeds in great many pieces each second, or megabits (Mbps), and billions of pieces each second, or gigabits (Gbps). Generally talking, the higher the bandwidth, the quicker the speed with which a computer downloads data from the internet whether users view messages or watch streamed motion pictures.

The [U.S. Federal Communications Commission](/fcc) (FCC) characterizes [broadband](/broadband) internet speeds as associations with a bandwidth of 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for transfers.

Suppliers state the bandwidth measurement to customers, yet that may not be the genuine bandwidth speed a customer gets. The association could have a [bottleneck](/bottleneck) where one network is limited by the lowest speed going to several computers immediately. More computers associated with a similar bandwidth speed can slow down the bandwidth for every individual who shares a similar association.

## Cable versus Internet versus Fios

In terms of hypothetical maximized execution, a cable modem generally has greater bandwidth than DSL. Cable technology, which communicates data over coaxial copper cables covered underground initially expected for TV, at present supports roughly 300 Mbps of bandwidth in numerous areas, while DSL speeds normally top at 100 Mbps. Genuine speeds can shift in practice contingent upon the quality of the copper telephone line establishment. Likewise, the length of the telephone line expected to arrive at the service supplier's central office likewise can limit the maximum speed a DSL establishment can support.

In 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) presented another service, Fios Instant Internet, that increased the internet speeds it offers to both residential and business customers, The broadband service furnishes customers with equivalent transfer and download speeds of 750 Mbps. Verizon guaranteed that with symmetrical speeds, the new service could handle various gadgets associated with the internet without compromising the performance of any of them.

Most types of DSL service are asymmetric, or ADSL. Regularly, ADSL offers higher download speeds than transfer speeds, which is normally not a drawback on the grounds that most families download a larger number of data from the internet than they transfer. Symmetric DSL keeps up with equivalent data rates for both transfers and downloads.

The primary selling point of DSL is far reaching accessibility; telephone infrastructure is as of now conveyed essentially all over the place, so it doesn't take a lot of set up to associate most customers to the internet through DSL, particularly in rural areas where cable is less inclined to be an option.
