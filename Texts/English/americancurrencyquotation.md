# American Currency Quotation
## What Is American Currency Quotation?

An American currency quotation is a quotation in the [foreign exchange markets](/foreign-exchange-markets) by which the value of the American dollar is stated as a for each unit measure of a foreign currency. This type of quotation shows the amount U.S. [currency](/currency) it takes to purchase one unit of foreign currency.

## Figuring out American Currency Quotation

For instance, an American currency quote would be US$0.85 per C$1. This shows that it will take 0.85 U.S. dollars to purchase a single unit of Canadian currency. To purchase C$1,000, it would cost US$850. The currency pair included is the CAD/USD.

Something contrary to an American currency quotation is a [European currency quotation](/directquote) where the foreign currency is the stated per-unit measure of the U.S. dollar. Utilizing the Canadian dollar again for instance, expect a rate of C$1.40 per US$1. This makes sense of that it will take 1.40 Canadian dollars to purchase a single U.S. dollar. In this case, the pair included flips to the [USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair).

In a currency pair, the primary currency listed is a single unit, and the joined number or quote shows the amount of the second currency it takes to buy that single unit of the first.

## Direct and Indirect Quotes

Brokers all the more frequently allude to quotes as direct or indirect, as opposed to American or European, albeit every one of the terms are utilized.

A direct quote is how much domestic currency it takes to purchase one unit of foreign currency. The USD/CAD rate, say 1.35, is the direct quote rate in Canada since it shows the number of Canadian dollars it that takes to buy one U.S. dollar. To somebody in the U.S., this would be an indirect quote.

## Deciphering an American Quote

American quotes incorporate the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair), AUD/USD, GBP/USD, and NZD/USD, since these pairs are showing the amount USD it takes to buy the main currency listed.

Expect the EUR/USD is trading at 1.1525. The next month it is trading at 1.1960. The pair has climbed in price, and that means the EUR has increased in value relative to the USD. It currently costs more USD to buy one euro.

Thusly, while taking a gander at a currency price chart, the principal currency in the pair is the directional currency. Assuming the rate is rising, the main currency is valuing relative to the second. Assuming the rate is dropping, the principal currency is dropping in value relative to the second.

Assuming that the rate drops from 1.1525 to 1.1310, the euro has dropped in value relative to the U.S. dollar.

## Illustration of an American Currency Quotation and Price Change

Expect that the [AUD/USD](/aud-usd-australian-dollar-us-dollar-currency-pair), an American quote, is trading at 0.6845. This means it costs $0.6845 to buy an Australian dollar. The European quotation of this rate would be 1.4609 (1/0.6845), which is the USD/AUD rate. This shows the number of Australian dollars it that takes to buy one U.S. dollar.

On an AUD/USD price chart, assuming the rate increases to 0.70, the AUD has increased value relative to the USD. Assuming the rate tumbles to 0.65, the AUD has lost value relative to the USD.

The chart above shows the AUD/USD daily prices. As the rate moves lower, the AUD is losing value (USD rising). The price settles inside a [price range](/tradingrange) for a period, in any case the price is as yet making lower [swing highs](/swinghigh) and in the long run breaks through the lower part of the reach. The break lower flags a debilitating AUD versus a more grounded USD.

While the AUD is falling, the USD is rising. This would be noticeable by taking a gander at a USD/AUD chart. All that would be turned over. At the point when the AUD/USD is falling, the USD/AUD would be rising, and vice versa.
