# Stagnation
## What Is Stagnation?

Stagnation is a prolonged period of practically zero growth in an economy. Real economic growth of under 2% annually is viewed as stagnation, and it is highlighted by periods of high unemployment and involuntary part-time employment. Stagnation can happen on a macroeconomic scale or a more limited size in specific industries or companies. Stagnation can happen as a brief condition, for example, a [growth recession](/growth_recession) or transitory economic shock, or as part of a long-term structural condition of the economy.

## Grasping Stagnation

Stagnation is a situation that happens inside an economy when total output is either declining, flat, or developing gradually. Tireless unemployment is likewise a characteristic of a stale economy. Stagnation brings about flat job growth, no wage increases, and a shortfall of stock market [booms](/blast) or highs. Economic stagnation can happen due to a number of causes.

### Cyclical Stagnation

Stagnation some of the time happens as a transitory condition in the course of a [economic cycle](/economic-cycle) or [business cycle](/businesscycle). This could occur as a growth recession or a stalled recovery from a full [recession](/recession). In late 2012, during the aftermath of the [Great Recession](/great-recession), allies of the Federal Reserve's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) considered the third round of [quantitative easing](/quantitative-easing) important to assist the United States with keeping away from economic stagnation. This type of stagnation is cyclical and brief.

### Economic Shocks

Specific occasions or economic shocks can likewise incite periods of stagnation. These might be exceptionally short lived or make enduring impacts, contingent upon the specific occasions and the flexibility of the economy. War and starvation, for instance, can be outer factors that cause stagnation. A sudden increase in oil prices or fall in demand for a key export could likewise prompt a period of stagnation for an economy. Nonetheless, a few financial specialists, who favor Real Business Cycle Theory, would think about such periods basically equivalent to cyclical stagnation.

### Structural Stagnation

A stale economy can likewise result from longer-term, structural conditions in a society. At the point when stagnation happens in a stable economy, it tends to be significantly more permanent than when it results from economic shocks or in the course of a normal business cycle.

Stagnation can occur in an advanced economy with economic maturity. Mature economies are described by more slow population growth, stable economic institutions, and more slow growth rates. Classical financial experts allude to this type of stagnation as a fixed state, and Keynesian financial experts think of it as the secular stagnation of an advanced economy. Institutional factors, for example, settled in power among incumbent special interest bunches who go against competition and receptiveness, can actuate economic stagnation. For instance, Western Europe experienced this type of economic stagnation during the 1970s and 1980s, named [Eurosclerosis](/eurosclerosis).

On the other hand, stagnation can burden immature or emerging economies. In these economies, stagnation continues due to the lack of change in political or economic institutions where there is no incentive to adjust and develop. Furthermore, emerging or immature economies might stall out in a static [equilibrium](/equilibrium) due to economic or institutional factors, for example, a [resource curse](/great-recession) or predatory behavior by neighborhood elites.

Social and population characteristics can likewise add to economic stagnation. A low-trust culture can cripple economic performance by deterring adherence to contracts and property-freedoms. A population with (on average) lower principles, lower general cognitive ability, or high rates of endemic, crippling disease can experience more slow economic growth thus.
