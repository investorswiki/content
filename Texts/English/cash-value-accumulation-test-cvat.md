# Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)
## What Is the Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)?

The cash value accumulation test (CVAT) is a test for deciding if a financial product can be taxed as an insurance contract instead of as an investment. The cash value accumulation test is utilized to ensure that the cash value of the insurance policy doesn't surpass the [present value](/presentvalue) of all future premium payments on the policy.

## Understanding the Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)

Having the option to breeze through the cash value accumulation assessment (CVAT) is unimaginably important to a policyholder as well as the insurer. Assuming that an insurance product neglects to pass, it is not generally thought to be an insurance product and is along these lines taxed like an investment.

Insurance policies can fill in value on a tax-deferred basis, with death benefits being exempt from income tax. Most different investments are taxed as [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome), implying that neglecting to breeze through the assessment will lead to a higher [tax rate](/taxrate).

The CVAT method is utilized when a policyholder would rather not be limited in that frame of mind of [premiums](/insurance-premium) that are able to be paid into the policy and needs to expand the [death benefit](/deathbenefit) that can be received. On the other hand, this method can be utilized when the policyholder plans to roll a large sum into the policy upfront however needs to limit the initial death benefit.

## Cash Valuation Accumulation Test versus Guideline Premium Test (GPT)

Notwithstanding the CVAT, an insurer has the option of planning a policy so it passes the [guideline premium test](/guideline-premium-and-hallway test-gpt) (GPT). The GPT limits the premiums that a policyholder pays relative to the death benefit, dissimilar to the CVAT, which limits the cash value relative to the death benefit.

The fundamental difference between these two tests is that CVAT limits the cash value relative to the death benefit, while GPT limits premiums paid relative to the death benefit. On the off chance that an insurance policy bombs both of these tests, it isn't viewed as a life insurance policy, and all income tax benefits are disposed of.

The insurer must show which test will be utilized on the issue date, and when the policy is issued, the insurer can't choose to utilize the other test option all things being equal. The decision of test can figure out what the policy premiums, cash value, and benefits will be.

## Illustration of the Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)

Under a CVAT test, a life insurance policy's cash surrender value might very well never surpass the net single premium that would be required to purchase those equivalent future benefits, bringing about tax benefits to the policyholder.

Here is a model: if a $150,000 whole life policy for a solid 40-year-old conveys a cash value of $15,000, to be eligible under this test the net single premium for this amount of coverage at that age must be something like $15,000. Assuming that the single premium is not exactly the [cash surrender value](/cashsurrendervalue), the policy won't pass the CVAT and will not qualify as life insurance yet will be viewed as an investment product that will bring about higher taxes.

It is critical for a policyholder to comprehend the difference of the product as it will straightforwardly connect with the payout that the beneficiary receives. Guaranteeing that the financial product qualifies as an insurance product will guarantee that the beneficiary will receive a larger payout when the policy is asserted.
