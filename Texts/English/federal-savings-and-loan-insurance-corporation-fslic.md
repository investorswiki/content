# Federal Savings And Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
## What Was the Federal Savings And Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)?

The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) is a defunct U.S. government institution that gave deposit insurance to savings and loan institutions until its disintegration toward the finish of the 1980s. Its liabilities were moved to the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) in 1989.

## Figuring out the Federal Savings And Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)

The FSLIC was first settled by Congress in 1934 as part of the [National Housing Act](/national-housing-act). Made closely following the [Great Depression](/great_depression), the FSLIC filled in as a safety net for the savings and loan industry. After the industry's essential collapse during the Depression, the government looked to reestablish confidence in the security of savings and loan accounts by backing them up so that assuming any given institution went under, the depositors' funds would in any case be safe. Deposits up to $100,000 were insured.

The FSLIC was regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). In comparison to FDIC, the FHLBB had a more modest staff and more vulnerable authority to oversee the S&L industry, which, generally, was genuinely traditional and stuck to regulatory worries satisfactorily. A combination of the releasing of regulation that permitted S&L institutions to make hazardous loans and the raising of deposit insurance coverage levels changed the grave industry into an unsafe one. At the level of the [savings and loans crisis](/sl-crisis), around one-third of financial institutions offering home loans to individuals and families had defaulted. Eventually, the FSLIC stepped in to stem the tide of bankruptcies. Yet, that job antagonistically affected its financials and, in the end, the agency was abrogated by the [Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)](/financial-institutions-reform-recovery-enforcement). FIRREA later redesignd the savings and loan industry and its regulation in response to the savings and loan crisis.

Different evaluations were put forward around then to save the FSLIC. Authorities from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that a bailout of the FSLIC would cost between $30 billion to $35 billion. After a month, the head of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), L. William Seidman, said $50 billion would be required. The GAO itself reconsidered its evaluations to $46 billion quite soon. By 1989, the FSLIC was past the point of saving, as it was at that point drawing on large measures of taxpayer money to give the essential funds to keep savings and loans institutions above water. The FSLIC Resolution Fund, financed by the Financing Corporation (FICO), was made to take care of all waiting obligations after the FSLIC was nullified.

## How is the Savings and Loan Industry Insured Today?

After the FIRREA produced results, the FSLIC's responsibility of guaranteeing savings and loan institutions was moved to the [Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC)](/resolution-trust-corporation), which merged into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation six years after the fact. The FDIC, likewise made in response to the Great Depression, currently insured deposits in commercial banks, so its liabilities widened to incorporate individual savings and loan accounts. The 2011 [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) increased the insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000.

Prior to the FSLIC's disintegration, billions of dollars of taxpayer money were utilized to keep the fund above water and operational, yet no taxpayer money has contributed to the FDIC's insurance funds. The FDIC has a $100 billion credit line through the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](/ustreasury). Credit unions are separately insured by the [National Credit Union Administration](/ncua), which has a similar insurance limit as the FDIC.
