## What Is a Reimbursement Plan?

A generic term for several types of plans that repay employees for different types of business related expenses. These expenses can include medical, auto, travel, dinner, and amusement costs. Reimbursement plans are established by employers to permit them to pay for a more accurate amount of employee expenses incurred, rather than giving a broad [allowance](/allowances) or increase in compensation to cover them.

Reimbursement plans can take many forms, for example, accountable and non-accountable plans, de minimis fringe benefits, or automobile mileage and travel allowances.

Employees must submit adequately-detailed records of expenses by means of logs or receipts for employers to be ableto deduct the reimbursements.

An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry. A vital expense is one that is useful and fitting for your trade or business. An expense doesn't need to be essential to be considered vital.

Certain states like California expect employers to repay employees' reasonable business related expenses, and any expense reimbursements received don't need to be reported as wages or income.

This is to guarantee that the expense records are appropriately kept up with in an ideal and accurate way. Numerous businesses have accountants or employment counsel prove the expenses and guarantee right reporting and deductions.
