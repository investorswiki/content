# Buy-Up
## What Is a Buy-Up?

A buy-up is a type of [rebate](/rebate) associated with [home mortgage loans](/home-mortgage). It includes the lender offering an upfront cash incentive to the borrower in exchange for accepting a higher [interest rate](/interestrate) on the loan.

Generally, buy-ups are more profitable to the borrower in the event that they hope to exchange the purchased property inside a short period of time. Significantly, the cash incentive can't surpass the [settlement costs](/closingcosts) associated with the loan.

## Understanding Buy-Ups

Buy-ups are commonly utilized by mortgage borrowers who wish to reduce their [out-of-pocket](/outofpocket) loan settlement costs. Since the buy-up brings about a higher interest rate on the loan, the borrower is successfully borrowing money at that higher rate and utilizing it to pay for some or all of the settlement costs.

Since the higher interest rate applies to the whole balance of the mortgage, selecting a buy-up is generally just prudent in the event that the borrower doesn't expect to hold on to the mortgage for an extended period of time. In these circumstances, the upfront cash incentive could more than offset the increased interest at any point cost, taking into account that those interest costs might be borne for a limited period of time.

One more consideration to know about is that buy-ups are likewise some of the time paid to [mortgage brokers](/mortgagebroker). In these circumstances, the broker can really be boosted to urge borrowers to acknowledge above-market rates on their mortgage loans, which are otherwise called [yield spread premiums (YSPs)](/yield_spread_premium).

Notwithstanding these improvements, be that as it may, the risk of potential conflicts actually remains. In particular, buy-up rebates and other such incentives are additionally at times given to [loan officers](/loanofficer) inside the lending institutions themselves. In these conditions, there might be minimal reasonable ability for the borrower to distinguish whether the rates they pay are impacted by these incentives. As a safety measure, borrowers ought to ask careful and direct inquiries to their loan officers about which, if any, incentive programs are in place as to their loan.

In that scenario, the buyer would receive a cash incentive of $2,500 in exchange for accepting a higher than normal interest rate.

Albeit the specific level of the new interest rate would be subject to negotiation, the ordinary formula is for every percentage of the rebate to bring about a 0.25% increase to the mortgage interest rate. Consequently, in the above model, the 2.50% cash incentive would bring about a 0.625% rate increase. The new interest rate would in this manner be 5.125%.
