# Lead Underwriter
## What Is a Lead Underwriter?

The term lead underwriter alludes to a [investment bank](/investmentbank) or another financial organization that has the primary directive for coordinating a [initial public stock offering](/ipo) (IPO) or a [secondary offering](/secondaryoffering) for public companies.

A lead [underwriter](/underwriter) generally works with other investment banks to lay out an underwriter syndicate and is responsible for evaluating the company's financials and current market conditions to show up at the initial value and number of shares to be sold.

## How Lead Underwriters Work

Underwriters survey and assess [risks](/risk). They are normally found working in the insurance and mortgage industries, alongside the debt and equity markets. Underwriters likewise help companies during their mission to open up to the world — that is, the point at which they go through the IPO interaction. They do this by assisting companies with getting ready for the offering and by filling in as the intermediary between the company and potential [investors](/investor).

A few companies might require more than one underwriter while the offering is very large to handle. The primary underwriting company, alluded to as the lead underwriter, puts together a group of underwriters. This group is called a [underwriter syndicate](/underwriter-syndicate) — a transitory group that cooperates to assist with carrying corporate offerings to the market.

The lead underwriter has a series of obligations including finishing a prospectus that is recorded with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). When the administrative work is documented, the primary underwriter can then make the initial strides that lead to the genuine offering. This incorporates creating [roadshows](/roadshow), which permit the company's key staff to hold introductions about the firm and its forthcoming offering to produce public interest.

Determining the last [offering price](/offeringprice) is one of the lead underwriter's major liabilities, which it does related to the [issuer](/issuer). This is finished by determining the size of the proceeds and determining how effectively investors will purchase the securities.

When a price is determined and the SEC makes the registration statement effective, the underwriters call the endorsers of confirm their orders. Assuming demand is especially high, the stock issuer might permit the lead underwriter to make an over-apportioning of shares. The two players might choose to raise the price and reconfirm the sale with endorsers. This is called a [greenshoe option](/greenshoe).

## Special Considerations

Being the lead underwriter for a stock offering — especially for an IPO — can bring a large payday if the [market](/market) shows a high demand for these shares. They carry a weighty sales [commission](/commission) — as much as 6% to 8% — for the syndicate, with the majority of shares held by the lead underwriter. This commission can increase when greenshoe options are offered. That is a result of the colossal demand that a few offerings bring.

Yet, there are substantial risks implied in underwriting stock offerings. Any company could dive in the open market once public trading starts. To this end large investment banks, like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and others will hope to conduct numerous different offerings in the course of a year. A couple of great offerings a year can be sufficient to meet company [earnings](/earnings) targets, yet market conditions as a whole generally determine the relative amount of profit that investment banks can earn.

In the zooming market phase of the last part of the 1990s, investment banks raked in some serious cash as enthusiastic investors ate up any new shares that came to market, and traded them a lot higher once on the [exchange](/exchange). Nonetheless, when the market imploded in late-2000, the underwriting community went into hibernation mode, encouraging even the best private companies to endure the tempest before [going public](/goingpublic).
