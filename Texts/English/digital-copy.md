# Digital Copy
## What Is a Digital Copy?

Digital copy in reference to cryptocurrency means a copy record of each and every confirmed transaction that has occurred over a peer-to-peer network, for example, the [bitcoin](/bitcoin) network.

A digital copy is a security feature of the bitcoin protocol planned to handle the problem of double-spending.

## How a Digital Copy Works

The rise of [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency) started in 2009 with the presentation of [bitcoin](/bitcoin). One of the impetuses behind the creation of bitcoin was the longing for a digital currency that couldn't be controlled by any central authority and wouldn't need a confided in outsider to guarantee transactions.

Dissimilar to bank transactions, there is no central record or database of bitcoin transactions. All things considered, bitcoin works through a decentralized network of independent PCs, every one of which keeps a separate record of every single confirmed transaction. This type of distributed ledger is known as a [blockchain](/blockchain).

## The Double-Spending Problem

Executing in digital currency utilizing a [decentralized system](/decentralizedmarket) brought about a problem known as double-spending. Double-spending happens when somebody endeavors to send similar coin to two distinct addresses.

In traditional currency, double-spending is forestalled by institutions like banks, clearinghouses, and online payment systems, which check account balances and transaction history and recognize [overdrafts](/overdraft). More established digital currency systems, like [eCash](/ecash), didn't have a satisfactory method for forestalling double-spending and were fruitless.

To tackle this problem, the inventor of bitcoin made an interaction by which each genuine transaction is independently shared and checked by numerous miners distributed across the network.

## The Distributed Ledger and Multiple Digital Copies

Each bitcoin transaction is communicated to a miner, what gathers many transactions into a block. At the point when another block is completed, the miner communicates the block to many other bitcoin nodes, every one of which compares the new transactions to their own digital copy of the blockchain. On the off chance that any node recognizes a double-spend, the new block is dismissed. Any other way, the nodes will transfer the new block to different nodes and miners.

This system actually forestalls double-spending by compensating genuine behavior and rebuffing agitators. Since miners are boosted through [block rewards](/block-reward), they have a financial interest in accepting just genuine transactions. On the off chance that a miner doesn't dismiss a double-spend, their block won't be shared by different nodes.

## Different Issues with Double-Spending

While digital duplicates for the most part safeguard the bitcoin network, there are rare conditions in which a double-spend could go undetected. This is a result of the longest-chain rule: at whatever point there are two contending renditions of the blockchain, the longest chain is viewed as the most definitive.

The most notable method for taking advantage of this property is through a 51% attack. On the off chance that a malicious actor controls the majority of the network's [hashing power](/hash), they can furtively make a separate, longer variant of the blockchain, with various transactions. At the point when the second rendition of the blockchain is distributed, it actually turns around any transactions which were executed on the more limited chain.

It is additionally workable for transactions to be incidentally turned around, due to the probabilistic idea of the blockchain. On the off chance that two miners separately discover new blocks simultaneously, the two adaptations will get by in the network until the next block is mined. At the point when this occurs, one form will be accepted by the network, and the other will be dismissed as a [orphan block](/orphan-block-cryptocurrency).

Consequently, bitcoin transactions ought not be considered genuinely 'last' until they are part of a chain with six additional blocks mined after the transaction. This is on the grounds that it is very impossible for six blocks to be switched. On something like one event, a bitcoin client had the option to reuse bitcoins that had previously been spent in an orphaned block.

## Features
- Albeit this system forestalls double-spending, there are a few conditions where bitcoins can be spent two times, like in a 51% attack.
- [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) transactions are not stored in a central database. All things considered, a great many digital duplicates of the [blockchain](/blockchain) are stored in bitcoin nodes, run by users around the world.
- Since there is no single authority on blockchain transactions, it is beyond the realm of possibilities for a malicious actor to modify the transaction history without approaching each digital copy.
