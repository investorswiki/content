# Try not to Reduce (DNR)
## What Is Do Not Reduce (DNR)?

A don't reduce (DNR) order is a type of order with a predetermined price that doesn't get adjusted when the underlying [security](/security) pays a cash [dividend](/dividend). Since a cash dividend reduces the assets of the company and transfers that wealth to the shareholder, the stock will drop by the amount of the dividend, all else being equivalent. Thusly, brokers change orders to mirror this change. In the event that the order is labeled as DNR, the price on the order won't be altered to account for the dividend payment.

## Understanding Do Not Reduce (DNR)

Investors who use [good until canceled](/gtc) (GTC) orders must know that their order's predefined price will be reduced with the distribution of [cash dividends](/cashdividend). The reduction of a GTC order's predetermined price is a market practice that assists with keeping the order price in accordance with the market's activity.

At the point when a company delivers a dividend to shareholders, the company is done holding that cash. In this manner, the value of the company ought to drop by the amount of the dividend paid. This reduction happens on the [ex-dividend date](/ex-dividend). All else being equivalent, if the stock closes at $50 on the day prior to the ex-dividend date, and delivers a $0.10 dividend, the stock ought to open at $49.90 on the ex-dividend date. In reality, different factors influence the price too, so the stock may not open at the hypothetical value.

Orders would likewise be adjusted by $0.10 to mirror the change in value of shares due to the dividend payment. A limit order to buy at $47 would be reduced to $46.90, for example.

Investors who wish at their predetermined cost to stay unchanged through cash distributions can do as such through a DNR order. Each broker has their own specific manner of establishing DNR orders. The investor might need to inform their broker that they would like a specific order to not be reduced. On the off chance that an investor doesn't request DNR then the predetermined order price on their [GTC](/gtc) order will be reduced on the company's ex-dividend date.

While not generally pragmatic, rather than submitting a DNR request the trader can physically change the price of their order back to the level wanted following the adjustment. They will be subject to their order being [filled](/fill) between the hour of adjustment and when the trader physically changes it back.

## DNR versus GTC orders

Try not to reduce is commonly a limitation that an investor must request while putting in a GTC request with a predetermined price. Investors have the option to place GTC buy or sell orders on underlying securities at their caution.

GTC orders can be favorable for investors for different reasons. Well known GTC orders incorporate limit buy, limit sell, and [stop orders](/stoporder).

A limit buy order is an order to buy a security at or below a predefined price. A limit sell order is an order to sell a security at a predetermined price or higher.

A sell stop order is an order to sell at a predetermined price or below. A buy stop buys at a predefined price or above.

These orders can assist an investor with dealing with their personal risk tolerance while making a trade.

A stop order to exit a position, called a [stop loss](/stop-lossorder), gives an approach to possibly cap losses, while limit sell orders give a method for locking in profits. Limit buy orders permit the investor to control their entry point into the investment.

With any of these orders, a trader or investor can request that the price they indicate not be reduced when the company (stock) delivers a dividend.

## DNR Trade Order Example

Expect a customer has placed a GTC limit order to buy 100 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at $205. The stock closed at $207.25 on the day prior to the ex-dividend date. Apple delivers a $0.77 quarterly dividend, so on the ex-dividend date, the price of the stock falls by $0.77 as the cash no longer has a place with the company. Thusly, the opening price on the ex-dividend date is $206.48 ($207.25 - $0.77). The dividend payment isn't the main factor that influences a stock's price; the real opening might contrast from the hypothetical price.

Despite what price the stock really opens at, except if the customer has indicated the limit buy order as a don't reduce (DNR) order, then, at that point, the buy price on the order will be adjusted to $204.23 ($205 - $0.77). In the event that a DNR order is given, the buy order will stay at $205.
