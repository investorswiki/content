## What Is VantageScore?

VantageScore is a consumer [credit rating](/creditrating) product developed by the main three credit bureaus, Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian, in 2006 as an alternative to the [FICO score](/ficoscore), made by the Fair Isaac Corporation in 1989.

## Grasping VantageScore

VantageScore 4, the latest form, is a [credit score](/credit_score) calculated through an average of five weighted factors:

1. Total credit usage, balance, and accessible credit
1. Credit mix and experience
1. Payment history
1. New accounts opened
1. Age of credit history

It utilizes advanced calculations and machine learning strategies that it claims make it more accurate than a FICO score. Various other potential factors are overlooked, "counting race, variety, religion, nationality, orientation, marital status, age, salary, occupation, employer, employment history, where you live, [and] total assets."

Early renditions employed a scoring scope of 501 to 990 with relating letter grades from A to F and weighted factors in an unexpected way. VantageScore 3, nonetheless, changed to a similar scoring range as FICO, 300 to 850, and dispensed with the letter grades, as does VantageScore 4.

FICO scores stay the most well known credit score, employed by around 90% of all lenders. Nonetheless, the utilization of VantageScore has been expanding, becoming by around 20% yearly since June 2015, in light of studies conducted by counseling firm Oliver Wyman. The latest study accessible, taking a gander at the year from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019, found that roughly 12.3 billion VantageScores were utilized by in excess of 2,500 users. Credit card issuers were the most productive users of VantageScore, trailed by banks.

## VantageScore Model and Components

Both VantageScore and the FICO score operate on data put away in consumer credit records kept up with by the three national credit bureaus. The models then, at that point, conduct a statistical analysis on the data to foresee the probability a consumer will default on a loan. Both VantageScore and FICO models imply the danger of loan default as three-digit scores, with higher scores showing a lower risk.

Anybody with a VantageScore of 600 or less is considered to have poor or extremely poor credit. An average or fair credit rating is anyplace somewhere in the range of 601 and 660. Somewhere in the range of 661 and 780 is viewed as a decent credit score, and anything north of 780 is viewed as magnificent.

The parts of a VantageScore are weighted as follows:

- Total Credit Usage, Balance, and Available Credit (Extremely Influential)
- Credit Mix and Experience (Highly Influential)
- Payment History (Moderately Influential)
- New Accounts Opened (Less Influential)
- Age of Credit History (Less Influential)

Total credit usage, balance, and accessible credit take a gander at a consumer's [credit utilization ratio](/credit-utilization-rate). For instance, assuming you have a $10,000 credit extension in one month and have drawn $5,000 from that line, your ratio would be half.

Credit mix and experience connect with the sorts of credit you have, with a mix of [revolving credit](/revolvingcredit, for example, credit cards, and [installment credit](/installmentdebt), like a mortgage or a vehicle loan, being viewed as the best. Payment history takes a gander at regardless of whether you have reliably paid your bills on time. New accounts include the number of solicitations for new credit you that have made, and the age of credit history is the manner by which long you have kept up with your credit accounts.

## Differences Between FICO Scores and VantageScores

There are several points of difference among FICO and VantageScore. FICO makes a single bureau-specific score for every one of the three credit bureaus, utilizing just information from that bureau. Thus, it is really three scores, not one, and they can fluctuate somewhat, as every bureau will have different information about a consumer.

A VantageScore is a single, tri-bureau score, consolidating information from every one of the three credit bureaus and utilized by every one of them. FICO scores require a credit history of something like six months, yet VantageScores can be calculated for people with a credit history that is under six months old, permitting it to rate roughly 40 million additional individuals than the FICO score.

[Hard inquiries](/hard-inquiry) can adversely influence credit scores, as they are an indication that the individual might be on the hook for more credit. FICO considers a 45-day window for student loans, vehicle loans, and mortgage requests, while VantageScore has a 14-day window for a wide range of loans. This means that on the off chance that various questions are made inside the window, they are treated as a single inquiry.

For instance, on the off chance that you take out a personal loan, apply for a credit card, and sign on to a mortgage inside a 14-day period, VantageScore will treat the three requests for your credit score as a single one. FICO, notwithstanding, will regard them as three requests, since it gives special cases just to certain types of loans.
