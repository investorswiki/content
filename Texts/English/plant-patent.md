## What Is a Plant Patent?

A plant patent is a [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty) right that safeguards a new and unique plant's key qualities from being duplicated, sold or utilized by others. A plant patent can assist a designer with getting higher profits during the patent protection period by keeping contenders from utilizing the plant. Plant patents in the United States are granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to the designer or the creator's heirs.

## How a Plant Patent Works

A patentable plant can be natural, reared or substantial (made from non-conceptive cells of the plant). It tends to be developed or found, however a plant patent might be granted to a found plant on the off chance that the discovery is made in a developed area.

The plant must be agamically reproducible, and the reproduction must be genetically indistinguishable from the original and performed through methods like root cuttings, bulbs, division, or uniting and sprouting to lay out the plant's stability. Tubers, like potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes, are additionally not eligible for plant patents, nor are plants that are unique simply because of developing conditions or soil fruitfulness.

Like any development, a plant must be non-clear to fit the bill for patentability. An alternate type of patent, the [utility patent](/utility-patent), applies to certain plants, seeds, and plant-reproduction processes.

## Requirements for a Plant Patent

A designer includes one year inside selling or delivering the plant to apply for a plant patent. The USPTO will possibly grant a plant patent assuming that the creator gives a full and complete organic description that makes sense of how the plant is unique and incorporates drawings showing the plant's unique elements. The candidate must likewise conform to the next point by point requirements for a [patent application](/temporary patent-application) and pay the significant fees.

A plant patent can have two named innovators: one who found the plant and one who agamically duplicated it. On the off chance that the development is a team exertion, each member of the team can be named as a co-creator.

While a plant patent safeguards the innovator's intellectual property rights for a long time from the patent-application-filing date, the patent application itself becomes public 18 months after the earliest patent filing date, and that means contenders will actually want to gain proficiency with the subtleties of the creation significantly earlier.

As well as applying for a plant patent, a creator could likewise have to apply for a utility patent or a [design patent](/design-patent) to safeguard the plant fully. For instance, in the event that the new plant assortment has a unique appearance, the creator would need both a plant patent and a design patent.
