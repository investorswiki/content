# Open
## What Is Open?

The term "open" shows up in several uses in the financial markets. Nonetheless, there are two that hold specific significance, contingent upon the setting in which they are utilized.

1. The open is the starting period of trading on a securities exchange or organized over-the-counter market.
1. An order to buy or sell securities is viewed as open, or in effect, until it is either canceled by the customer, until it is executed, or until it lapses.

## Figuring out Open
### Market Open

Contingent upon the [exchange](/exchange) or scene, the open might be the primary executed trade price for that specific day. Almost certainly, the open price won't be equivalent to the previous day's closing price.

Other settings could sample trading for a short period of time close to the beginning of the official trading day and make an official open. It could conceivably be equivalent to the price of the principal trade. This might be the method utilized for securities that have almost no trading activity and may just be the previous day's close.

Various exchanges will have different opening times. For example, the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) and the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) open at 9:30 am EST, while the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) opens trading in U.S. Treasury securities futures at 8:20 am EST (7:20 CST).

### Order Open

The primary justification for why an order stays open is that it conveys conditions, for example, price [limits](/limitorder) or [stop](/stoporder) levels, dissimilar to a [market order](/marketorder). A limit order to buy, entered when the current traded price of the security is now over that limit price, won't execute until such time that the market declines to meet it. A buy stop order won't transform into a market order until the security arrives at a predetermined price level.

Another explanation may essentially be the lack of liquidity for that specific security. In the event that there are no settled offers and offers by market producers or other traders then no trading happens.

There is a connected use for the term open that is of interest to futures and options traders. [Open interest](/openinterest) is the total number of open or outstanding options or futures contracts that exist at a given time. In contrast to the stock market, where the number of shares outstanding is fixed by the actual company and doesn't change frequently, open interest in the derivatives markets changes continually. This can yield important data to traders and analysts about how forcefully market participants act in rising and falling price trends.
