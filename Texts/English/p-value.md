# P-Value
## What Is P-Value?

In statistics, the p-value is the probability of getting results as extreme as the noticed consequences of a statistical [hypothesis test](/hypothesistesting), expecting that the [null hypothesis](/null_hypothesis) is right. The p-value fills in as an alternative to dismissal points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be dismissed. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence for the alternative hypothesis.

P-value is frequently used to promote credibility for studies or reports by government agencies. For example, the United States Census Bureau stipulates any analysis with a p-value greater than 0.10 must be accompanied by a statement that the difference isn't statistically not quite the same as zero The Census Bureau likewise has standards in place stipulating what p-values are acceptable for different publications.

## How Is P-Value Calculated?

P-values are normally found utilizing p-value tables or spreadsheets/statistical software. These calculations depend on the assumed or known [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution) of the specific statistic tried. P-values are calculated from the deviation between the noticed value and a picked reference value, given the probability distribution of the statistic, with a greater difference between the two values corresponding to a lower p-value.

Numerically, the p-value is calculated utilizing vital math from the area under the probability distribution curve for all values of statistics that are to some degree as distant from the reference value as the noticed value is, relative to the total area under the probability distribution curve. The calculation for a p-value differs in view of the type of test performed. The three test types portray the location on the probability distribution curve: lower-tailed test, upper-tailed test, or two-sided test.

More or less, the greater the difference between two noticed values, the more outlandish it is that the difference is due to simple random chance, and this is reflected by a lower p-value.

## The P-Value Approach to Hypothesis Testing

The p-value approach to hypothesis testing utilizes the calculated probability to decide if there is evidence to dismiss the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis, otherwise called the "guess," is the initial claim about a population (or data-creating process). The alternative hypothesis states whether the population parameter varies from the value of the population parameter stated in the guess.

In practice, the significance level is stated in advance to decide how small the p-value must be to dismiss the null hypothesis. Since various specialists utilize various levels of significance while looking at an inquiry, a reader may here and there experience issues comparing results from two distinct tests. P-values provide a solution to this problem.

For example, suppose a study comparing returns from two particular [assets](/resource) was embraced by various specialists who utilized similar data yet unique significance levels. The analysts could reach opposite resolutions with respect to whether the assets contrast. In the event that one specialist utilized a confidence level of 90% and the other required a confidence level of 95% to dismiss the null hypothesis and the p-value of the noticed difference between the two returns was 0.08 (corresponding to a confidence level of 92%), then, at that point, the main scientist would find that the two assets have a difference that is [statistically significant](/statistically_significant), while the second would track down no statistically huge difference between the returns.

To stay away from this problem, the specialists could report the p-value of the hypothesis test and permit readers to interpret the statistical significance themselves. This is called a p-value approach to hypothesis testing. Independent eyewitnesses could note the p-value and choose for themselves regardless of whether that represents a statistically massive difference.

## Example of P-Value

An investor claims that their investment [portfolio's](/portfolio) performance is equivalent to that of the [Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index](/sp500). To decide this, the investor directs a two-tailed test. The null hypothesis states that the portfolio's returns are equivalent to the S&P 500's returns over a specified period, while the alternative hypothesis states that the portfolio's returns and the S&P 500's returns are not equivalent â€” assuming the investor led a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis would state that the portfolio's returns are either not exactly or greater than the S&P 500's returns.

The p-value hypothesis test doesn't be guaranteed to utilize a preselected confidence level at which the investor ought to reset the null hypothesis that the returns are equivalent. All things considered, it provides a measure of how much evidence there is to dismiss the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis. In this way, assuming the investor finds that the p-value is 0.001, there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis, and the investor can unhesitatingly finish up the portfolio's returns and the S&P 500's returns are not equivalent.

Albeit this doesn't provide a precise threshold regarding when the investor ought to accept or dismiss the null hypothesis, it enjoys another extremely practical benefit. P-value hypothesis testing offers a direct method for comparing the relative confidence that the investor can have while picking among multiple various types of investments or portfolios relative to a [benchmark](/benchmark) like the S&P 500.

For example, for two portfolios, An and B, whose performance varies from the S&P 500 with p-values of 0.10 and 0.01, respectively, the investor can be significantly more sure that portfolio B, with a lower p-value, will really show reliably various outcomes.

**Revision April 2, 2022:** A previous variant erroneously depicted the p-value as the probability of results emerging through random chance.

## Features
- A p-value is a statistical measurement used to approve a hypothesis against noticed data.
- The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the noticed difference.
- P-value can act as an alternative to or notwithstanding preselected confidence levels for hypothesis testing.
- A p-value of 0.05 or lower is generally viewed as statistically critical.
- A p-value measures the probability of getting the noticed outcomes, it is true to expect that the null hypothesis.
## FAQ
### Is a 0.05 P-Value Significant?
A p-value under 0.05 is typically viewed as statistically huge, in which case the null hypothesis ought to be dismissed. A p-value greater than 0.05 means that deviation from the null hypothesis isn't statistically critical, and the null hypothesis isn't dismissed.
### What Does a P-Value of 0.001 Mean?
A p-value of 0.001 demonstrates that assuming the null hypothesis tried were without a doubt true, there would be a one out of 1,000 chance of noticing results to some degree as extreme. This leads the eyewitness to dismiss the null hypothesis on the grounds that either an exceptionally rare data result has been noticed, or the null hypothesis is inaccurate.
### How Might You Use P-Value to Compare Two Different Results of a Hypothesis Test?
On the off chance that you have two distinct outcomes, one with a p-value of 0.04 and one with a p-value of 0.06, the 0.04 will be thought of as statistically critical while the 0.06 will not. Past this simplified example, you could compare a 0.04 p-value to a 0.001 p-value. Both are statistically critical, however the 0.001 provides an even stronger case against the null hypothesis than the 0.04.
