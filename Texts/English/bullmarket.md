# Bull Market
In the stock market, **bulls** are examiners who accept that their investments are developing. Hopeful in nature, their optimistic outlook can drive market prices higher, while their wild determination allows them to face any short-term challenge head-on — just like their namesake.
In 1989, stone worker Arturo di Modica installed a bronze bull on Broadway at Bowling Green Park in Manhattan's financial district. He made it as a symbol of disobedience after the tempestuous Stock Market Crash of 1987. The monstrous sculpture stands ready to charge, its horns thrust skyward, its position enlarging, and its hooves leaving the ground — a harbinger for better days ahead.

## What Is a Bull Market?
A **bull market** is a time of expansion. Something contrary to [recession](/recession), it's a period wherein stock prices on major indexes like the [S&P 500](/sp500) or the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) are rising. This is typically a time when the economy is developing, consumer confidence is high, and individuals are spending.
Utilizing market data to recognize trends (a practice known as **technical analysis**), analysts have measured an official bull market as a period when the S&P 500 increments no less than 20% after two distinct declines of 20%. The S&P 500 is seen as a barometer of the overall market's wellbeing since it is comprised of the 500 biggest companies by float-adjusted market cap.
## What Is a Bear Market?
There's a legend on Wall Street that characterizes markets by the activities of bulls and bears in fight: Bulls thrust upward, utilizing their horns, while bears swipe downward with their paws.
A [bear market](/bearmarket) is the inverse of a bull market. It is a period of decline in the S&P 500 of no less than 20% for quite some time or longer. A bear market eradicates gains from a bull market and is characterized by negative investor sentiment, cynicism, and even fear. During this time, the economy slows, unemployment rises, productivity fades, and businesses' profits shrink.
In any case, there wouldn't be bull markets without bear markets; both are important parts of the business cycle, just as growth and contraction, or expansion and [recession](/recession), characterize the more extensive economy.
It's important to note that a bear market isn't equivalent to a [correction](/market-correction), which is a shorter-term pullback in stock prices, usually due to a news event, economic data, or earnings report that fell below expectations. A bear market, then again, is a more extreme, longer decline that typically lasts somewhere in the range of 14 and 16 months.
## Is a Bull Market Good or Bad?
Bull markets absolutely **feel** better, yet everything relies upon what type of investor you are. Long-term buy-and-hold investors breathe easy in light of bull markets realizing that their assets are developing, while put options traders, short-sellers, and inverse ETF investors all profit from bear markets.
Is a bull market ever terrible? Soaring growth has its downside. [Asset bubbles](/bubble) can form. This happens when stocks, industries, real estate, or different assets quickly rise without underlying fundamental justification. The website bubble, which filled in the late '90s and burst in 2000, is one such model. After a period of "unreasonable exuberance," the tech sector saw an excited selloff, and the NASDAQ exchange, which was comprised of technology companies, lost over 75% of its value.
## How Long Can a Bull Market Last?
As the idiom goes, "nothing can escape the pull of gravity," and keeping in mind that many buy-and-hold investors hope a bull market will last everlastingly, true to the business cycle, the stock market will continuously experience periods of growth and decline.
In any case, it's interesting to note that there have been just as many bull markets as bear markets starting around 1928, despite the fact that bull markets will quite often last a whole lot longer. As a matter of fact, the longest bull market in stock market history lasted over 10 years, from March 2009 to March 2020. In this way, to any investor stressed that we may be entering a bear market: not to fear, as history shows it's short-term.
