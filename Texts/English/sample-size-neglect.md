# Sample Size Neglect
## What Is Sample Size Neglect?

Sample Size Neglect is a cognitive bias broadly concentrated by Amos Tversky and [Daniel Kahneman](/daniel-kahneman). It happens when users of statistical data make false ends by failing to consider the [sample size](/sample) of the data being referred to. The underlying reason for Sample Size Neglect is that individuals frequently fail to comprehend that high levels of [variance](/lawoflargenumbers) are bound to happen in small samples. In this manner, it is critical to determine whether the sample size used to deliver a given statistic is sufficiently large to consider significant ends. Knowing when a sample size is adequately large can be trying for the people who don't have a decent comprehension of statistical methods.

## Understanding Sample Size Neglect

Most statistical surmising relies upon the [law of large numbers](/lawoflargenumbers). This expresses that with a sufficiently large sample, the qualities of the population from which the sample is drawn can be inferred, with some degree of confidence, from the attributes of the sample. At the point when a sample size is too small, accurate and dependable ends can't be drawn. Sample size neglect comprises of overlooking the effect of small samples on our ability to draw such ends. With regards to finance, this can deceive investors in different ways.

For example, an investor could see a commercial for another investment fund, bragging having generated 15% [annualized returns](/annualized-complete return) since its initiation. The investor may rush to reason that this fund is a ticket to quick wealth generation. Nonetheless, in the event that the fund hasn't been around extremely long, this end could misguide the possible investor. The outcomes might be due to short-term irregularities and have barely anything to do with the fund's genuine investment methodology.

Sample Size Neglect is frequently mistaken for [Base Rate Neglect](/base-rate-false notion), which is a connected cognitive bias. While Sample Size Neglect alludes to the failure to consider the job of sample sizes in determining the dependability of statistical claims, Base Rate Neglect connects with individuals' propensity to neglect existing information about a phenomenon while assessing new data.

## Real World Example of Sample Size Neglect

To better comprehend Sample Size Neglect, consider the accompanying model, which is drawn from Tversky and Kahneman's research:

>
> A person is approached to draw from a sample of five balls, and observes that four are red and one is green.
>
>
> A person draws from a sample of 20 balls, and observes that 12 are red and eight are green.
>
>
> Which sample gives better evidence that the balls are predominantly red?
>

A great many people say that the first, smaller sample gives a lot more grounded evidence in light of the fact that the ratio of red to green is a lot higher than the larger sample. Be that as it may, in reality the higher ratio is offset by the smaller sample size. The sample of 20 really gives a lot more grounded evidence.

One more model from Tversky and Kahneman is as per the following:

>
> A town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital, an average of 45 children are conceived every day, and in the smaller hospital around 15 children are conceived every day. Albeit half of all infants are young men, the specific percentage varies from one day to another.
>
>
> During one year, every hospital recorded the days on which over 60% of the infants turned out to be young men. Which hospital recorded all the more such days?
>

At the point when posed this inquiry, 22% of respondents said that the larger hospital would report all the more such days, while 56% said that the outcomes would be no different for the two hospitals. Truth be told, the right response is that the smaller hospital would record all the more such days, in light of the fact that its smaller size would deliver greater variability.

As we noted before on, the foundation of Sample Size Neglect is that individuals frequently fail to comprehend that high levels of variance are bound to happen in small samples. In investing, this can be expensive for sure.

## Highlights
- Sample Size Neglect is a cognitive bias concentrated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.
- It comprises of drawing false ends from statistical data, due to having not considered the effects of sample size.
- Those wishing to reduce the risk of Sample Size Neglect ought to recollect that smaller sample sizes are associated with additional unstable statistical outcomes, as well as the other way around.
