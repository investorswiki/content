# Quarter-To-Date (QTD)
## What Is Quarter-To-Date (QTD)?

Quarter-to-date (QTD) is a period interval that catches generally significant company activity that happened between the beginning of the current [quarter](/quarter) and the place where the data was accumulated later in the quarter. Quarter-to-date data is commonly assembled in circumstances when the whole quarterly period has not yet ended, and it can permit management to perceive how the quarter is getting down to business.

## Figuring out Quarter-To-Date (QTD)

In financial speech, a quarter alludes to a three-month period during a [fiscal year](/fiscalyear). Since there are 12 months in a year, there are four quarters: first quarter (Q1), second quarter (Q2), second from last quarter (Q3), and fourth quarter (Q4).

To decide how a company is performing during a given quarter, management might need to pull up data from the very outset of the quarter for a certain area to check how it has performed up to this point.

For instance, a company might have a target [revenue](/revenue) of $5 million for the quarter. The finish of the quarter is as yet one month away and management might want to see the quarter-to-date revenue to decide whether they are on target to meet the $5 million target.

Contingent upon the outcome, the QTD data assists management with settling on a choice to one or the other remain on track, as the company is on target, or to change course since they will miss their target number.

QTD data permits management to investigate why a certain measurement isn't on target and to address the issue. This is especially valuable while contrasting similar periods with prior fiscal years or to different quarters.

## Quarter-To-Date Data Analysis

Many companies invest a great deal of energy setting up their quarter-to-date reports. All data must be clean and free of errors. Fittingly utilized, accurate, and convenient QTD reporting can assist a company with making a move on working on its performance.

A QTD analysis is best towards the finish of the quarter, as there is more significant data accessible to survey the quality of results. That being said, required changes are more significant prior in the quarter as there is additional opportunity to effect change. Management must track down a balance between the two.

A QTD analysis is commonly just for internal use instead of for outer use in light of the fact that the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) doesn't expect companies to report data before a quarter has ended. QTD data is a tool for management to decide the progress of the business.

Thusly, there are relatively few QTD comparisons between companies since management might pull data at various times inside a quarter. That being said, last quarterly outcomes are particularly comparable between companies.

While looking at quarterly outcomes, taking note of that not all company's utilization the calendar year as their fiscal year is important. Guaranteeing that you are contrasting precisely the same time span among companies, and subsequently staying away from [seasonal](/seasonality) factors, will take into account logical comparison.
