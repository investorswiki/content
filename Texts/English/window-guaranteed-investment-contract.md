This type of [guaranteed investment contract](/guaranteedinvestmentcontract) (GIC) contrasts from other GICs in that the investor makes principal payments in installments after some time, as opposed to in one lump sum front and center. Investors use window guaranteed investment contracts with [401(k) plans](/401kplan) and other defined contribution annuity plans.

## Understanding Window Guaranteed Investment Contracts

When the contract develops, the insurance company returns the investor's principal and interest to them, and they can opt to [reinvest](/reinvestment) in another GIC.

Even however the "G" in GIC represents guaranteed, window GICs are at last backed simply by the insurance company that sells them. They are not backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the United States government. Along these lines, they contrast from certificates of deposit insured by the [FDIC](/fdic). All in the event that the insurance company becomes bankrupt, the investment could lose its value.
