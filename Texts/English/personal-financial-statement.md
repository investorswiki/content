## What Is a Personal Financial Statement?

The term personal financial statement alludes to a document or spreadsheet that frames an individual's financial position at a given point in time.

The statement can assist individuals with tracking their financial objectives and wealth, and can be utilized when they apply for [credit](/credit).

## Figuring out the Personal Financial Statement

[Financial statements](/financial-statements) can be prepared for either companies or individuals. An individual's financial statement is alluded to as a personal financial statement and is a less difficult variant of [corporate statements](/financial-statements).

A personal financial statement shows the individual's [net worth](/networth) — their assets minus their liabilities — which reflects what that person has in cash assuming they sell every one of their assets and pay off the entirety of their obligations. In the event that their liabilities are greater than their assets, the financial statement shows a negative net worth. On the off chance that the individual has a larger number of assets than liabilities, they end up with a positive net worth.

Keeping a refreshed personal financial statement permits an individual to follow how their financial wellbeing improves or crumbles over the long haul. These can be priceless tools when consumers need to change their financial sitution or apply for credit like a loan or a [mortgage](/mortgage).

The statement permits likewise [credit](/credit) officers to effectively gain point of view into the candidate's financial situation to settle on an informed credit choice. Generally speaking, the individual or couple might be approached to give a personal guarantee to part of the loan or they might be required to put up [collateral](/collateral) to secure the loan.

## Special Considerations

A personal financial statement is broken down into assets and liabilities. Assets incorporate the value of [securities](/security) and funds held in checking or savings accounts, retirement account balances, [trading accounts](/tradingaccount), and real estate. Liabilities incorporate any obligations the individual might have including personal loans, credit cards, student loans, [unpaid taxes](/back-taxes), and mortgages. Obligations that are jointly owned are additionally included. Married couples might make joint personal financial statements by consolidating their assets and liabilities.

Income and expenses are likewise included assuming the statement is utilized to achieve credit or to show somebody's overall financial position. This can be followed on a separate sheet or an addendum, called the [income statement](/incomestatement). This incorporates all forms of income and expenses — commonly communicated as month to month or yearly sums.

The accompanying things are excluded from a personal financial statement:

- **Business-related assets and liabilities:** These are excluded except if the individual is straightforwardly and personally responsible. So if somebody [personally guarantees](/personal-guarantee) a loan for their business — like [cosigning](/co_sign) — the loan is remembered for their personal financial statement.
- **Rented items:** Anything rented is excluded from personal financial statements on the grounds that the assets aren't owned. This changes assuming you own the property and rent it out to another person. In this case, the value of the [property](/property) is remembered for your asset list.
- **Personal property:** Items, for example, furniture and household goods are regularly excluded as assets on a personal balance sheet in light of the fact that these things can only with significant effort be sold to pay off a loan. Personal property with huge value, like jewelry and collectibles, might be incorporated in the event that their value can be checked with a [appraisal](/appraisal).

> Business liabilities are possibly remembered for a personal financial statement in the event that an individual gives the creditor a personal guarantee.
>

Keep at the top of the priority list. Your credit report and [credit history](/credit-history) are big contemplations with regards to getting new credit and each [lender](/lender) has different requirements for giving credit. In this way, even on the off chance that you have a positive net worth — a larger number of assets than liabilities — you might in any case be denied a loan or [credit card](/creditcard) in the event that you haven't paid your previous obligations on time or have too numerous requests on file.
