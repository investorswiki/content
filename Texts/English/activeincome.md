## What Is Active Income?

Active income alludes to [income](/income) received for performing a service. Wages, tips, salaries, commissions, and income from businesses in which there is [material participation](/material-participation-test) are instances of active income.

## Figuring out Active Income

There are three principal categories of income: active income, [passive (or unearned) income](/passiveincome), and [portfolio income](/portfolioincome).

Income received as a paycheck from an employer is the most common illustration of active income.

For the [self-employed](/self-employed) or any other person with an ownership interest in a business, income from business activities is viewed as active on the off chance that it meets the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) definition of material participation. That means something like one of coming up next is true:

- The taxpayer does the majority of the work in the business.
- The taxpayer works over 100 hours in the business during the year, and no other staff works a greater number of hours than the taxpayer.

Assuming somebody gets income from a business in which they don't actively take part, then that is viewed as passive income. Portfolio income, in the mean time, is income from investments, for example, [dividends](/profit) and [capital gains](/capitalgain).
