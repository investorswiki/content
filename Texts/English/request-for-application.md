# Request for Application (RFA)
## What Is a Request for Application (RFA)?

A request for application (RFA) is a type of solicitation notice in which an organization reports that [grant funding](/government-grant) is accessible. A grant is a financial award awarded by the federal, state, or neighborhood government for the benefit of a project or research. A RFA informs researchers and different organizations that they might introduce [bids](/bid) on how the funding could be utilized. The request for application will ordinarily frame what type of programs are eligible, what the expectations are, and the way that applications are submitted and investigated.

## Figuring out Request for Application (RFA)

A request for application is normally associated with [government agencies](/federal-agencies) and [non-benefit institutions](/non-profitorganization), as these organizations are more probable than non-governmental agencies to release money as grants. For instance, a government agency has reserved funding for research on green energy. It releases a RFA demonstrating the rules and limitations of the project, how much money is accessible, and the scope of the project (in this case, green energy).

## Request for Application (RFA) as Part of the Grant Process

A request for application is one part of the grant-production process. The cycle has many stages and generally starts with a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), in which a federal agency promotes its goals to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, as a rule at the consequence of a competition for funds. A FOA is before long followed by a Program Announcement (PA), which unveils needs or areas of accentuation, and sets the timing rules for how long the opportunity is open. The RFA is the next step, trailed by a [Request for Proposal (RFP)](/request-for-proposal), which is a solicitation for contract proposals, lastly, a Notice (NOT), which reports policies and procedures, amendments to the RFA or PA announcements and other informational things.

## Instances of a Request for Application (RFA)

A RFA will remember a diagram of the project for question, how applications will be assessed, the timing of both the submission and evaluation cycle and more key information.

### The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
